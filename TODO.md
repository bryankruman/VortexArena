# XonoticGodot — Active TODO (single source of truth)

**This is the living task tracker.** The two analysis docs are *point-in-time snapshots* and should not be used to
manage work:
- `../REBIRTH_FEATURE_COMPLETENESS.md` — independent audit (2026-06-05) + diff-impact revision. Reference for *why*/*where*.
- `planning/legacy/REMAINING-WORK.md` — the team's earlier gap list. Historical.
- `planning/legacy/todo/phase-*.md` — the original phased plan. Historical.

Created 2026-06-05 from `REBIRTH_FEATURE_COMPLETENESS.md` Part III (P0–P3), incorporating the post-audit diff.

> **📎 Every task is a *port*, not an invention — confirm parity from Base *before* writing code.** Each task's
> canonical Base/Darkplaces source file(s) are listed in the **§ Base/ source map** at the bottom of this file.
>
> **Mandatory per-task protocol (do this for EACH feature, in order):**
> 1. **Read the cited Base source FIRST** and pin down *exactly* how the feature behaves — inputs/outputs, edge cases,
>    spawnflags, the cvars it reads + their shipped defaults, order of operations, and which hook/call-site drives it.
>    **Do not infer behavior from the existing C#, from this file's summaries, or from memory** — the summaries here
>    (and the `…`-truncated source-map lines) are pointers, not the spec.
> 2. **Open the actual file** at `Base/data/xonotic-data.pk3dir/qcsrc/…` (or `Base/darkplaces/…` for engine C) and read
>    the full function(s) — the source-map entry only names them. Confirm parity intent before any code.
> 3. **Implement by mirroring** that behavior (same constants/defaults/branch order); deviations must be deliberate and
>    commented.
> 4. **Cite the source** in the port file's `// Port of <path>` header (the convention 124 port files already follow).
>
> Parity is judged **against Base, not against the port.** The Wave-1 / 2026-06-07 re-audits show what happens when this
> is skipped — drifted cvar defaults, conflated hooks (`PM_Physics`), and "ported" code that doesn't match the
> reference. See **§ Wave-1 fidelity audit** and **§ 🔬 Parity re-audit**.

## How this is managed (orchestrated fan-out, no per-item locks)

A **single coordinator** (an orchestrator session, or a `Workflow` run) assigns disjoint slices of work to
sub-agents each burst. There is **no claim/lock ritual** — non-overlap is guaranteed by the coordinator, not by
agents editing this file. Two fields make that safe and are the heart of this tracker:

- **`Touches`** — the files/globs a task will modify. **The conflict key.** The orchestrator may run tasks in
  parallel **only if their `Touches` sets are disjoint.** Tasks that share a hot file (see the conflict map) must
  be serialized.
- **`Blocked-by`** — prerequisite task IDs. Only dispatch a task whose blockers are ☑.

**Step 0 of every dispatched task = read Base for parity.** Before any code is written, the agent must open the task's
**§ Base/ source map** entry *and the cited Base file(s)* and confirm exactly how the feature works (see the mandatory
protocol at the top). A task brief should quote the Base behavior it is porting; "implement X" with no Base reading is
not a valid dispatch. This is the single discipline that has kept the port faithful across Waves 1–3.

**Update rule:** the orchestrator (not the worker agents) flips a task's checkbox and status when a batch lands,
and periodically re-syncs the affected rating in `REBIRTH_FEATURE_COMPLETENESS.md`. Keep IDs stable (`T#` = Part III
item #). If you add a task, give it the next free `T#` and fill in `Touches`/`Blocked-by`.

**Status legend:** ☐ not started · ◐ in progress (a batch is dispatched) · ☑ done · ⏸ deferred
**Priority:** 🔴 P0 (blocks a playable game-from-menu) · 🟠 P1 (faithful feel / important) · 🟡 P2 (breadth/fidelity) · ⚪ P3 (long tail/polish)

## ⚠️ Hot-file conflict map (serialize tasks that share a row)

The orchestrator must **not** run these together — they edit the same file:

| Hot file | Contended by | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `src/XonoticGodot.Server/GameWorld.cs` | **T2, T3, T6, T14, T17, T35, T36, T39, T42** | Biggest contention point. Consider splitting it, or serialize. (Re-audit added item-spawn, objective-wire, bot-tick, overtime call-sites.) |
| `src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Weapons/*.cs` | **T2, T6, T16, T19, T51, T57** | Serialize all weapon-touching tasks (T2 first — it reshapes the fire path). T51 adds Overkill weapons; T57 the weapon tail. |
| `game/PlayerController.cs` | **T4, T15** | Camera work and keybind-consumption both edit it. |
| `src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Damage/DamageSystem.cs` | **T3, T11, T16, T18, T40, T43, T45, T57** | Coordinate / serialize. Re-audit added combat-sound/obituary, monster-damage, warpzone-radius, accuracy call-sites. |
| `src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/MapObjects/MapObjectsRegistry.cs` | **T14, T22, T35, T36, T48, T52, T59** | The single spawnfunc registry — now the hottest file: items, mode-objectives, content tail, compat remaps all register here. Serialize. |
| `src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Registries.cs` + `GameInit.cs` | **T17, T19, T26** | New registrations + source-gen activation. |
| `src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/GameTypes/*.cs` | **T7, T8, T17, T18, T36, T42, T53** | Scoreboard wiring, team-spawn, new modes, mode-depth, objective spawns, overtime, round-stat networking. |
| `src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Mutators/MutatorHooks.cs` | **T37, T44** | Vehicle lifecycle hooks + PM_Physics/IsFlying — both add hook chains. |
| `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Commands.cs` | **T38, T46, T47, T56, T60, T70** | Minigame/chat/generic/admin verbs + the client-command-bus gate + the admin/util cmd tail all touch the command table. |
| *(post-re-audit note)* | — | The 9 dead-code-activation tasks (T35–T43) mostly add *call-sites* into existing files (GameWorld/DamageSystem/MapObjectsRegistry) rather than new files — so they contend more than the Wave 1–3 tasks did. Prefer serializing within a hot file over worktrees here. |

## ✅ Recently landed (post-audit — do NOT re-dispatch)

These closed/moved after the 2026-06-05 audit (see the `↻` notes in `REBIRTH_FEATURE_COMPLETENESS.md`):
- ☑ **Menu-side HUD-editor** — 22 `DialogHudPanel*` + `DialogHudPanels` + `DialogHudSetupExit`, cvar-bound. (T27 narrowed to the *in-game* editor.)
- ☑ **First windowed visual verification** — `game/ScreenshotHook.cs` (caught + fixed a DDS bug). (T5 narrowed to *systematic* multi-map QA.)
- ☑ **Skeletal player rendering** — `game/client/PlayerModel.cs` + `LocomotionBlend.cs` + `PlayerSkeletonConfig`. (Does **not** close the view/camera gap T4.)
- ☑ **Inline-trigger bbox firing fix** — `MapObjectsCommon.InitTrigger` now `SetModel`s inline brush models.
- ☑ **`ModelInfoAndBlendTests`** — partial progress on T31.

### ✅ Wave 1 landed (2026-06-05) — T1, T2, T4, T7, T13, T20

All six Wave-1 tasks shipped (6 parallel agents, disjoint `Touches`), then an adversarial QC-faithfulness + cross-seam
review pass; the build is clean (0 errors) and **258 tests pass** (was 257 + a new spawn-equip regression guard). The
review found **1 blocker + 10 majors** that build/tests didn't catch — all fixed before marking done:
- **[blocker] Networked fire was inert** — spawned stock players never equipped a weapon (`ActiveWeaponId == -1`); the
  loadout filled only the NetName set, not the canonical `OwnedWeaponSet`. Fixed in `SpawnSystem` (QC `w_getbestweapon`
  on spawn) + a regression test (`SpawnLoadoutTests`). *The wire chain (input→buttons→driver) was already correct.*
- **[major] Hook secondary** spawned ~72 gravity bombs/s (no refire gate) → gated via `PrepareAttack` + a `RefireFor` override.
- **[major] `ServerNet.ProvideInput` double-drain** — input dequeued twice/tick (movement + weapon) over-acked under jitter
  → made idempotent per sim tick (cache keyed on `_world.Time`).
- **[major] T20 dlight tween on a detached node** → NRE on every explosion; **sizeincrease Curve clamped to 1.0** →
  growing particles never grew. Both fixed in `EffectSystem`.
- **[major] T7 `NetworkedFields` cache** keyed on `FieldCount` (never changes) → stale column layout on mode switch →
  now invalidated by a label-generation counter.
- **[major] T4 FOV** dropped the QC `*0.75` aspect-normalization (~16° too wide); **eventchase death-cam** ignored the
  `cl_eventchase_death == 2` velocity-settle gate (+ wrong default). Both fixed in `PlayerController`.

**Emergent follow-ups (new — see T34 + the T9 note):** the menu "Start"/connect path runs through the new
`game/net/NetGame.cs`, so T4's view feel lives where the user doesn't play it. ViewEffects (damage-flash + liquid-tint)
+ the `*0.75` FOV were wired into NetGame here; **zoom, death-cam, the full HUD, and the view-model are still NetGame-TODO**.

### ✅ Wave 2 landed (2026-06-06) — T3, T6, T8, T10, T12, T14, T21

All 7 shipped via a conflict-safe 2-phase fan-out (T3·T10·T12·T21 ‖ then T6·T8·T14), then an adversarial review (29
findings: 6 major / 14 minor / 9 nit, 0 blockers) → 17 fixed + 1 deferred (rifle trace) + the rest folded into the
tasks below. **Build clean, 266 tests pass; both headless play paths verified** (`--net-loopback`, `--host atelier --bots 2`).
What each delivered + the **residual wiring** a future wave must do to make it *fully observable on the menu→play path*:
- **T3** — mutator activation loop (`MutatorActivation.Apply` = `base.qh` STATIC_INIT_LATE) wired into `GameWorld.Boot`;
  all 9 dormant hooks now fire (incl. the once-dead `EditProjectile` at 21 projectile-spawn sites + `GiveFragsForKill`
  in `Scores.Obituary`). Enabling `g_dodging`/`g_instagib`/… now changes a match.
- **T6** — reload (`W_Reload`/`clip_load`), `switchdelay_raise/drop`, full `selection.qc` + impulse map landed. **Residual:**
  per-weapon ammo must route through `clip_load` to make reload *observable*, and the **net client→server impulse channel**
  is missing (humans can't switch/reload in net play yet) → folds into **T34** / a net-input task.
- **T8** — team-spawn selection (the `spawnpoints.qc` teamcheck ladder + `have_team_spawns` + `info_player_teamN`). `targetCheck=true` parity for the 2 other call sites is a **T18** (Onslaught) dependency.
- **T10** — all 7 panels ported + registered in `HudManager`. **Residual:** they only live in the `--map` `Hud`, not
  `NetGame`'s `NetHud`, and need their net data feeds → **T34**.
- **T12** — antilag rewinds monsters+nades, measured RTT, predictor reads replicated movevars. Nade rewind is dormant until **T11** spawns nades.
- **T14** — `monster_*`/`turret_*`/`vehicle_*`/`monsters_spawner` spawnfuncs registered; hand-placed NPCs spawn + think. Reset-on-round-restart deferred to the NPC subsystem tasks.
- **T21** — true-aim coloring (HITENEMY/TEAM/WORLD) + switch cross-fade. **Residual:** needs `Crosshair.AimForward` fed +
  the HUD wired into `NetGame` → **T34**; the rifle through-wall trace (**new follow-up**) needs an `Api.Trace` body/corpse-only content-mask.

### ✅ Wave 3 landed (2026-06-06) — T9, T11, T15, T16, T17, T18, T19, T22, T34

All 9 shipped via a conflict-safe **3-phase fan-out** (recon → P1: T9·T11·T16·T18 ‖ P2: T15·T19·T22 ‖ P3: T17·T34),
then a **12-agent adversarial review** (37 findings: 1 blocker / 6 major / 24 minor / 6 nit; T16 + both seam reviews
came back *faithful*). **Build clean, 548 tests pass** (was 306 at wave start; **+242**). The blocker + 4 majors +
3 high-confidence minors were fixed; **2 majors carried forward** (below). Key structural win confirmed by recon: the
audit's `DamageSystem.cs`/`Registries.cs` contention **dissolved** — the T3 hook call-sites are live and
gametypes/mutators auto-register by attribute, so most "core" work became hook handlers in *new* files.
- **T9** — ScoreInfo wire (per-mode score label/flags) so a remote client's `LayoutHash` matches the server (it was
  silently dropping the whole scoreboard block every snapshot); `LatestScoreboard` now fed into NetGame's
  `ScoreboardPanel`; configurable columns/sort/value-format. **Residual:** accuracy/rankings/map-stats render from
  settable surfaces but aren't fed on the net path yet; per-row ping/pl not networked; CTF team banner shows the
  ST_SCORE slot, not the primary team slot.
- **T11** — powerup consumers (strength/shield via `DamageCalculate`, speed via a new `WeaponRateFactor` hook, invis
  alpha) + the **full nades subsystem** (registry, throw/charge/bonus, projectile, **11 boom types**). **Residual
  (carried major):** nades are *un-throwable on the play path* — `Entity.OffhandFirePressed` is set nowhere (no
  offhand/nade `InputButtons` bit); needs a button bit + bind + server apply (shares the pre-existing
  `OffhandBlasterMutator` gap). Client render (timer model, trails, darkness overlay) out of scope (headless).
- **T15** — binds-xonotic.cfg consumed on both play paths (NetGame + PlayerController); cvar store = source of truth;
  `MenuSettings` keybinds quarantined. **Review fixes:** `+fire2` secondary alias + the `togglezoom` press-latch (the
  stock MOUSE3 zoom bind). **Residual:** runtime console `bind`/`unbind` doesn't translate engine key names (minor).
- **T16** — headshot head-AABB + multiplier (hitscan/rail) + rifle bullethail continuation. *(Review: faithful.)*
- **T17** — Mayhem + Team Mayhem (score = damage + frags), all 3 scoring methods verbatim; widened the
  `PlayerDamage_SplitHealthArmor` hook to fire unconditionally (more QC-faithful) via a back-compatible 8-arg
  `PlayerDamageArgs`.
- **T18** — Onslaught CP/generator combat; CTF pass/throw/retrieve; Domination round variant; Race penalty/overtime.
  **Review fixes:** wired `ctf.Tick()` into the frame loop (passing was inert — a missed pass lost the flag forever),
  CTF throw/pass antispam now enforced, Onslaught `ONS_TAKES` no longer over-credited on a build-capture. **Residual:**
  CTF pass-in-flight is an instant transfer (no headless projectile integrator); thrown flag uses body not view
  pitch (no `ViewAngles` field yet); Dom pre-match tick guard needs a synced `game_starttime`.
- **T19** — **10 of 12 mutators live** (rocketminsta, stale_move_negation, random_gravity, globalforces, vampirehook,
  weaponarena_random, new_toys, spawn_near_teammate, spawn_unique + the dormant 2 below). **Orchestrator wiring:** the
  `MutatorHooks.FireStartFrame` pump was added to `GameWorld.OnStartFrame` (random_gravity et al. were dormant), and
  the **blocker fix** seeds `Entity.DamageForceScale` (=`g_player_damageforcescale`, 2) on spawn so knockback +
  globalforces actually apply. **Residual:** random_items + physical_items are structural shells (need a map
  item-entity spawn pipeline / ODE); **rocketflying (carried major)** is inert until the Devastator stores its
  detonate gate on the missile entity (it writes the wrong field today; conf=low).
- **T22** — logic gates + `target_*` utilities + `func_door_secret`/conveyor/ladder. **Review fix:** door_secret now
  opens via per-entity `GtEventDamage` (the `Combat.Death` hook was unreachable at 10000 HP). **Residual:** entity
  `.reset` bodies are ported but dormant (no map_restart reset pass); `target_give`/`target_items` can't find map
  items until they're in the targetname index; magicear/target_spawn templating cut.
- **T34** — shared `FirstPersonView` (zoom/death-cam) for NetGame+GameDemo; full HUD adopted on the net path (**review
  fix:** dup crosshair/health hidden, the unfed Timer hidden); **C2S impulse channel** (`InputCommand.Impulse`,
  protocol→5) so weapon switch/reload reach the server via `WeaponImpulses.Handle` — **closes T15's deferred residual**.

**Carried-forward majors:** (1) **T11** nade-throw input wire (an offhand `InputButtons` bit → `OffhandFirePressed`,
+ bind + server apply) — **STILL CARRIED** (offhand-gated, wants a live check); (2) **T19c** rocketflying detonate-gate
— ✅ **RESOLVED in Wave A1** (new `Entity.ProjectileDetonateTime` on the Devastator/Minelayer missile, cleared by the
mutator's `EditProjectile`). **T5** (windowed visual QA) is still ☐ — deferred to a live-run pass.

### ✅ Wave A1 landed (2026-06-07) — T35, T40, T44, T38, T50, T58, T19c

All 7 forward-plan A1 tasks shipped via recon → parallel-impl → adversarial-review → fix (4 workflows; 7·7·7·6 agents).
**Build clean, 734 tests pass** (was 548 at wave start; **+186**); the real play path boots headless clean (`--host
atelier` — map loads, `ServerNet` accepts the player, exit 0, no exceptions). Review (7 reviewers, refute-by-default):
**0 blockers / 3 majors / 14 minors / 1 nit** — **T19c came back with ZERO findings**; T35/T40/T44/T38 faithful. All 3
majors + 13/14 minors + the nit fixed.
- **T35** — world-item spawn + touch (`StartItem`/`ItemSpawnFuncs`/`Item_Touch`→`ItemPickupRules`): every
  `item_*`/`weapon_*`/powerup/buff classname now spawns + is collectable; loot toss/lifetime/spawn-shield, weapon-stay
  (+ `g_weapon_stay==2` stay-ammo), powerups don't spawn at t=0, full `GiveItems` op grammar (shared w/ target_items +
  cheats). **Closes the "no pickups on any map" P0.** New `Entity.CanPickupItems` (FL_PICKUPITEMS) tagged on spawn.
- **T40** — server combat-event emission: `Scores.Obituary` now fires kill-feed/frag/typefrag/killstreak/first-blood
  via the (already-built) `NotificationSystem`; pain/death/drown + armor/body-impact sounds at the damage sites;
  warmup/round COUNTDOWN announce. New central `DeathMessages` table (the `wr_killmessage` successor — kept OUT of
  weapon files); `Warmup`/`Rounds.OnCountdownTick` → GameWorld-wired. **The biggest "feel" cluster.**
- **T44** — `PM_Physics`/`IsFlying` mutator hook call-sites (the T3 "PM_Physics wired" claim was WRONG → now REAL;
  unblocks bugrigs/T51) + spectator free-flight (`SPECTATORSPEED` seed/ladder, new `Entity.SpectatorSpeed`, wishmove
  scaled by maxspeed_mod). **Residual:** spectator-fly is inert until a `spectate`→fly-movetype transition exists
  (ClientManager/Commands — not in A1; the physics + the GameWorld move-gate are correct + dormant until then).
- **T38** — minigame activation: `MinigameSessionManager` + `cmd minigame create/join/part/end/invite` + the S2C
  session snapshot (`NetControl.MinigameState`, protocol→6, orchestrator-wired in ServerNet) + the in-game minigame
  HUD menu. Pong/TTT/C4 startable+playable. **Residual:** Bulldozer ships no on-disk levels (best-effort, out of P0).
- **T50** — menu command dispatch (directmenu/nexposee/closemenu/servers/profile/settings) + PauseMenu Join!/Spectate/
  Leave/Quick + visual pickers (crosshair/charmap/colorpicker/playermodel/reorderable `cl_weaponpriority`).
- **T58** — csqcmodel render hooks: force-model/colors, LOD `_lod1/_lod2`, deathglow/respawn-ghost, fallback-frame
  remap, `EF_*`/`MF_*` lights+trails. **Review caught a real bug:** server `EntityMutatorState.EffectFlags.FullBright`/
  `NoShadow` were mislabeled (8/8192 = EF_DIMLIGHT/EF_NODEPTHTEST) vs the engine 512/4096 the client reads → instagib/
  buffs fullbright never rendered → **fixed** (server + client now agree). New client appearance API wired via NetGame.
- **T19c** — rocketflying detonate-gate (carried major RESOLVED): `Entity.ProjectileDetonateTime` replaces the
  closure-local gate on the Devastator/Minelayer missile; `RocketFlyingMutator.EditProjectile` clears it.

**Durable lessons (for A2+):** (a) the `GameWorld.cs`/`ServerNet.cs` chokepoints held to **1 task/wave-owner** with
the other tasks **reporting exact seam snippets the orchestrator integrates** worked cleanly (no clobbers) — the model
the conflict map predicts. (b) Recon mis-pathed two partial-`Entity` files (`EntityItemState` is under Gameplay/Items,
not Framework; `PlayerPhysicsState` didn't exist → agent created it) — verify partial-Entity homes. (c) `XonoticGodot.Common.Gameplay`
contains BOTH a sub-namespace-leaf `Notifications` AND a type `Notifications`, so `using …Gameplay.Notifications;`
fails (CS0138); the notification types (`NotificationSystem`/`MsgType`) live in `…Gameplay` and come via the plain
`using XonoticGodot.Common.Gameplay;`. (d) **Two real fidelity bugs build+tests missed** — T58 EffectFlags (above) and a
T44 spectator wishmove-cap (the fly-branch capped wishspeed at base speed regardless of `SPECTATORSPEED`) — both
caught by the adversarial review + a feel-oriented test; keep the review pass. (e) **Deferred:** T58
death-frame/`death_time` networking (needs a `NetEntity` wire-widen → T54 territory); 2 stale private TEST copies
(CountdownAnnouncerTests' game-start helper; a charmap assert) for a test-quality pass.

**Playable-from-menu** advanced: floor pickups + combat feedback + working minigames now live on stock maps.

### ✅ Wave A2 landed (2026-06-07) — T36, T43, T37, T51, T56, T28, T30

All 7 A2 tasks shipped via the proven model — **recon → parallel-impl → adversarial-review → fix** (4
workflows: 7 recon · 7 impl · 8 review · 3 fix agents). The orchestrator pre-added the cross-task hook
interface (`MutatorHooks`: 4 vehicle hooks + `PlayerDamaged`) so every impl agent compiled against a stable
seam, then integrated 9 cross-task snippets serially (no two agents edited the same file in the parallel
phase — the A1 chokepoint-owner model held cleanly again). **Build clean (0 errors), 1046 tests pass** (was
738 at wave start; **+308**); the real play path boots headless clean (`--net-loopback`: 0 errors / 0
warnings, exit 0). Adversarial review (8 reviewers, refute-by-default): **0 blockers / 8 major / 14 minor /
3 nit** — every major + the high/medium-impact minors fixed; 1 review finding (F10 WallFriction) was itself
**refuted** as a false positive (the code was already correct). Carried follow-ups are in
`planning/legacy/wave-a2/deferred-findings.md` (all low/nil-impact or recon-deferred).
- **T36** — Assault/Nexball/Invasion/CTS map-objective spawnfuncs now route through `GametypeObjectiveSpawns.Sink`
  → `WireObjectiveSpawns` → each gametype's spawn API; Assault destructible→decreaser→objective links resolve
  spawn-order-independently via `Assault.ResolveObjectiveGraph` in a new `GameWorld.Boot` post-spawn hook;
  `ApplyDictFields` now plumbs `cnt`/`health`/`dmg`. **Those modes finally have a win path on a real map.**
  KeyHunt left alone (keys round-spawn — adding `item_kh_key` would double-spawn). *Carried:* `func_assault_wall`
  collision-toggle (F11), STAGE round-end volume (F12), empty-spawnmob wave (F24).
- **T43** — monster damage→pain/death/reset wired via Option A (a `GtEventDamage` shim installed on spawn —
  **zero DamageSystem edits**); `-100` live/`-50` corpse gib thresholds, faithful double-push knockback,
  `monsters_total`/`killed` counters (reset on map-load), `Monster_Reset`, default armor seed, INVINCIBLE
  lava/slime exemption, `g_monsters_score_kill`. Fixed the 2 cfg-default bugs (respawn 10→20, spawnshield
  1→2). *Carried:* per-monster `mr_death` corpse cosmetics (F16).
- **T37** — vehicles are **boardable + drivable**: new `VehicleBoarding` (use-key board radius 250 + guards +
  MULTISLOT gunner + impulse mode-switch); `GameWorld.OnClientMove` seated-gate writes `VehInput` + skips
  PM_Main + (review fix) skips the on-foot weapon driver; Bumblebee touch-board gated to `g_vehicles_enter==0`.
  *Documented partials:* touch-mode board, controller/`ACTIVE_NOT`/delayspawn, steal, client-side seated
  prediction (all recon-scoped out); gunner-hook slot1 (F25).
- **T51** — doublejump **fixed** (conditional surface-trace + velocity-clip via a real `DoublejumpMutator`;
  default `sv_doublejump 0` keeps golden traces byte-identical); the 5 **Overkill weapons** implemented
  (auto-register; `g_overkill` now grants them) incl. the okhmg superweapon gate + clip-aware reload + the
  ammo-check dispatcher; **bugrigs** (`PM_Physics` race-car drive), **hook** (offhand grapple), **campcheck**,
  **damagetext** (server feed + `DamageTextLayer` + the `PlayerDamaged` fire-site), **itemstime** backend
  (feeds the ITEMSTIME panel). *P3 stubs w/ documented substrate blockers:* breakablehook, kick_teamkiller,
  dynamic_handicap; *explicit deferral:* superspec, sandbox.
- **T56** — `defer` (sim-clock queue → a passed `restart` vote **now fires**), the **RPN VM** (crc16/bound
  fixed to DP-exact, `time` op), `maplist`/`addtolist`/`removefromlist`/`nextframe`, client verbs
  (voice/suggestmap/autoswitch/physics/clientversion), reply verbs (records/rankings/lsmaps/printmaplist/
  ladder + cvar_purechanges), `editmob`/spawnmob/killmob (+ in-vehicle gate). *Deferred (documented):* the
  RPN DB-family + qc_curl/dumpcommands/restartnotifs/runtest.
- **T28** — the i18n layer: a Godot-free **PO gettext engine** (C-escapes/octal/continuation/overlay-order),
  `Tr`/`CtxTr` seam through `Ui`/`MenuScreen`/`CvarControls`, data-driven `languages.txt` picker, `menu_restart`
  rebuild; the full **`SkinValues`** schema (skin-customizables.inc) backing `MenuSkin`. *Carried (content, not
  code):* no `common.*.po` ship in `XonoticGodot.Assets` yet, so translation is inert at runtime until they're
  added (F2). Octal multi-byte (F23) theoretical.
- **T30** — `trace_t.DpHitTextureName` is now **truthfully populated** (shader name threaded `Brush`→SAT
  sweep→`TraceResult`, mirroring the SurfaceFlags template; corpus byte-identical) — unblocks the `common/caulk`
  spawn-rejection. Golden-trace loop: corpus cross-validated against the live engine config +
  `verify-against-dp.md` capture plan (full DP-capture pipeline deferred pending a gmqcc `progs.dat` rebuild,
  per recon — honest increment, not over-claimed).

**Durable lessons (for A3+):** (a) **pre-adding the cross-task interface symbols** (hook chains) before the
parallel impl let every agent compile against a stable seam and removed `MutatorHooks.cs` from the parallel
edit set entirely — the single highest-leverage orchestration move this wave. (b) The "owner edits the file;
others return exact integration snippets the orchestrator applies serially" model held with **zero clobbers**
across 7 concurrent agents (the agents even self-reconciled transient cross-task build breaks mid-run). (c)
refute-by-default review pays for itself: it caught a real every-vehicle-use bug (seated player firing their
hand weapon) that build+1017-tests missed, AND a reviewer false-positive (F10) that refuting saved a wasted
fix. (d) Per-agent test counts are mid-run snapshots — only the orchestrator's post-integration full run is
authoritative.

**Playable-from-menu** is now reached (A1+A2): pickups, combat feedback, working bots/NPCs damage+death,
vehicles, and objective win paths on stock maps.

### ✅ Wave A3 landed (2026-06-10) — T39, T57, T48, T53, T54, T26, T31, T33

All 8 A3 tasks shipped via the proven recon → parallel-impl → adversarial-review → fix model (the impl phase was
session-limit-truncated mid-run and committed by the user as `ba83632`; the orchestration this session **finished
the integration the truncated agents had handed back as snippets**, fixed the resulting test failures, ran the
review, and fixed the findings). **Build clean (0 errors), 1446 tests pass** (was 1158 at wave start; **+288**); the
real play path boots headless clean (`--host atelier --bots 4`, exit 0, 0 hard errors). Adversarial review (6
dimensions × refute-by-default verify, 26 agents): **0 blockers / 5 major / 14 minor confirmed real / 1 refuted** —
all 5 majors + the cheap-clear minors fixed; the rest documented as residuals below.
- **T39** — HavocBot AI **live**: `BotPopulation` (bot_serverframe/bot_fixcount: fill/remove, skill resync,
  strategy-token rotation, danger cadence) + `BotDanger` (havocbot_checkdanger) wired into `GameWorld.OnStartFrame`;
  bot input rides the SAME per-tick path humans use (GameWorld branches on `p.IsBot`); `--bots N` now spawns bots
  that move/navigate/fight/respawn. **Review fix (major):** strategy-token no longer deadlocks on a dead/observer
  holder (the whole population had stopped rating goals); **+ bot_nofire** honored. *Residual:* bots fire primary
  only — no per-weapon `wr_aim` secondary (devastator detonate / mortar airburst), a documented AI simplification.
- **T57** — weapon tail: `W_ThrowWeapon` (impulse 17 + death-drop + `PinataMutator`), accuracy tracking
  (`WeaponAccuracyEvents` fired/hit/real with `accuracy_isgooddamage` gates) → `Scores.AccuracyBytes` → the **owner-only
  accuracy wire** (reconstructed this session: appended at the owner-state END, gated by AccuracyGeneration) →
  `ScoreboardPanel`/`WeaponsPanel.SetAccuracy`; Vortex chargepool + velocity-charge + forced reload. **Review fix:**
  `accuracy_byte` rounding now DP-`rint` (round-half-up, not banker's). **Weapon by-id fix (major):** `weapon_byid_N`
  now selects the QC-faithful order (blaster,shotgun,… via a weapon-local `WeaponOrder.ByIdOrder`), not the
  alphabetical RegistryId (which had `weapon_byid_0`→arc).
- **T48** — map content tail: `misc_laser` hazard (+ beam render), decoration models
  (`misc_gamemodel`/`func_static`/…), `func_pointparticles`/`func_sparks`, `func_rain`/`func_snow`, `target_speaker`,
  `target_music`/`trigger_music`. **Root-cause review fix (2 majors):** `MapObjectFieldsExtra.Apply` was called only
  on the offline `--map` path, never `GameWorld.ApplyDictFields` (`--host`), so on the live path every content-tail
  key (mdl/effect, scale, fade, music lifetime/fade, weather dir, wall solid) was silently dropped — now applied on
  both paths.
- **T53** — round/objective HUD stats for CA/FreezeTag/KeyHunt/Survival: `GametypeStatusBlock` codec (alive counts,
  KH 5-bit key pack w/ 31=self, Survival role + the **hunter-disclosure anti-cheat** — prey never receive hunter ids
  mid-round) wired into the snapshot (hash-gated per-peer) + `ModIconsPanel`/scoreboard eliminated grey-out. **Review
  fixes:** FreezeTag rules-freeze (NULL attacker) no longer deducts a victim point; Survival roles now count live
  players only + pick hunters RANDOMLY (was fixed roster order).
- **T54** — movement/prediction breadth: full MOVEVARS replication (40→46), `Physics_ClientOption` presets
  (`g_physics_clientselect`), `sentcvar`/`sendcvar` (cl_weaponpriority/autoswitch/noantilag/physics). **Review fix
  (major):** the movevar decode no longer clobbers an authoritative configured/replicated **0** back to the Xonotic
  default (CPMA/Nexuiz/Quake3 servers were silently getting Xonotic stepdown/airstrafe) — wire slots are authoritative,
  cvar fallback is now EXISTS-gated, and absent unregistered movement cvars capture the stock default so the default
  deployment doesn't rubber-band. Golden movement traces stay byte-identical.
- **T26** — source generator activated: emits Monster/Turret/Vehicle registrations + the `Bootstrap()`→`RegisterAll()`
  swap.
- **T31** — test coverage: +parser/builder/NPC/turret/vehicle/minigame suites (Md3/Dpm/Iqm/Sprite/BspLayout,
  Turret*, Monster*, Vehicle*, minigame rule engines). **Caught 2 real production bugs** the impl phase missed (a
  turret death-hook clobbered by the player-corpse path; bots force-respawned past DEAD_DEAD) — both fixed.
- **T33** — CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` + `ci/ci.sh`), perf benches (`tests/.../Perf/*`, measurement-first),
  packaging (`export_presets.cfg`, `tools/{package,run-dedicated}.sh`), `ADR-0014`.

**Carried residuals (documented, deferred):** bot secondary-fire (`wr_aim` ATCK2); bot custom-weapon-priority lists
ship empty; enemy-stick/moving-target strategy interval; Survival panel hides at round-end vs QC's next-countdown +
no row colormap; CA/Survival eliminated≈dead (no INGAME_JOINING state); T57 spectator accuracy-share
(`sv_accuracy_data_share`); zombie/other-monster attack damage read once at construction not live-cvar (default-correct);
the SourceGen weapon-order assertion is a round-trip (a by-id pin was added). **Also (port extension, kept):**
`sv_step_upspeed_scale`/`_max` step-up vertical-velocity limiter — see [[rebirth-stepup-velocity-limiter]].

**Playable-from-menu** now includes live bots, working accuracy/weapon-throw, map ambience/hazards/music, and
per-mode round HUD.

### ✅ Wave A4 landed (2026-06-12) — T41, T42, T46, T52, T23, T27, T66, T67 (+ T24 formally cut)

All 8 A4 tasks shipped via the proven **recon → parallel-impl → adversarial-review → fix** model (4 workflows). Batch-1
(T42·T27·T46·T52·T66·T67·T23·T24) ran in parallel on disjoint hot files **with no concurrent builds**; **T41** integrated
last (it splices into T42's `GameWorld` rewrite + T27's `NetGame` input hook). **Build clean (0 errors / 0 warnings),
1735 tests pass** (was 1456 at wave start; **+279**) — **independently re-verified**; the headless `--quit-after` smoke
and the dedicated `--host stormkeep --bots 2` smoke are both clean (map loads, bots fill, handshake accepted, 0 managed
exceptions). Adversarial review (10 reviewers, refute-by-default, every finding independently re-refuted): **16 confirmed
(3 blockers / 6 major / 5 minor / 2 nit)** — **all fixed except 2 correct no-ops**. Headline lesson (again): build +
unit-tests were green but **four host seams were dead on the live path** — computed + unit-tested, never *delivered* —
the port's recurring "ported-but-unwired" failure mode, caught only by the review.
- **T41** — client feedback: view.qc HitSound (`cl_hitsound` confirm beep off a networked damage-dealt stat), the
  clock-driven announcer **time-remaining** VOICE (`announcer.qc`; the 3-2-1 countdown is already T40, so `Tick` drives
  only time-remaining → no double-fire), and the objective crosshair rings (NADE>CAPTURE>REVIVE). **Review fixes (blocker
  ×2):** `ServerNet` never networked the new `Feedback` fields → rings/hitsound were host-only → now in the player
  snapshot; **`FreezeTag.ReviveTick` was never called** → revive ring dead → now driven per-frame via a networkable
  `Entity.ReviveProgress`.
- **T42** — `CheckRules_World` overtime/sudden-death cascade (`InitiateSuddenDeath`/`InitiateOvertime`/`GetWinningCode`):
  a tied timed DM/TDM/CTF/Dom/KH now enters overtime/sudden-death (extending the live `timelimit` cvar) instead of
  **drawing**, via a new `OverTimeManager` + a virtual `GameType.ReportsTie` on the 11 timed score modes; campaign gated.
- **T46** — full `server/chat.qc Say()`: `say_team`/`tell`/`ignore`/`unignore`/`clear_ignores`, the 4 `g_chat_*` gates,
  per-type flood, mutual-ignore routing, muted fake-accept, `formatmessage` macros. **Review fixes (blocker ×2):**
  `cmd.ChatToPlayer`/`ChatConsole` were never wired in `NetGame.StartListenServer` → all team/private/spectator delivery
  silently no-op'd → now wired (stock + threaded paths).
- **T52** — Q3/QL/CPMA/Q1/WoP/Q3DF compat *add*-side remaps (weapon/item classname tables + ammo `.count` scaling + Q3DF
  `target_*`). **Review fixes (major ×2):** `CompatRemaps.IsCtsActive` unwired (→ `target_score`/`target_fragsFilter`
  self-deleted on **every** map) and the `"frags"` map-key never promoted to `Entity.Frags` — both wired in `GameWorld`.
- **T27** — `hud_config.qc` in-HUD configure editor (drag/resize, grid-before-collision snap, Ctrl+Tab/Space/Z/S,
  normalized cvar write-back). **Review fixes:** `K_PAUSE` now passes through during edit; faithful `ftos_mindecimals`.
- **T23** — the shared menu `DataSource` abstraction + screenshots/music/skins/server-info/create-game map-info backends +
  `MapInfoBackend` (.mapinfo parser). **Review fixes:** the complete-but-orphaned `DialogMediaSkinList` and
  `DialogCreateGameMapInfo` are now wired to their live paths (skin list in Settings/User; map-info popup on map dbl-click).
- **T66** — fires the `FilterItem` item-spawn hook (6 subscribers were dead) → NIX strips map items, Duel blocks powerups,
  MeleeOnly strips small health/armor; `NetName` assigned before the hook.
- **T67** — HLAC crouch-spread modifier (ducked+grounded), mirroring Machinegun.
- **T24** — **formally cut** (0 importer LOC; see the table row).

**Carried residuals (documented):** STAT(OVERTIMES) client net (HUD "OVERTIME" banner) → T54/T23-net; round modes
(CA/FreezeTag) + objective-latched (Onslaught/Assault) keep the no-tie default; chat mutator-bus hooks + active_minigame
team branch + ServerProgsDB-permanent ignores deferred (in-memory PersistentId ignore used); chat `%x`/`%y` tokens fall
back (no server chat tracer); `Muted` not yet seeded from `g_chatban_list` at connect; T52 SG↔MG arena swap +
target_print Q3DF mode + target_init buff-drop need a live `q3compat`/.arena flag; T41 CaptureProgress ring hidden (no
Dom/Onslaught producer — faithful: Base never sets it) and rings are crosshair-anchored vs QC's 0.6×height anchor + no
per-ring labels; T23 playerstats list honest "pending" (no stats DB) + some buttons await T50 `menu_cmd`; T66
`Duel.FilterItem` still unregistered (GameItemDef signature); T27 chat-panel min-size/hover-fill/cursor-shape + a real
`hud save` file-writer deferred.

### ✅ Wave A5 landed (2026-06-12) — T45, T47, T59, T61, T68, T69, T29, T49, T5

All 9 A5 tasks shipped via **recon → parallel-impl → adversarial-review → fix** (4 workflows). Recon resolved all
contention to disjoint file ownership, so the 9 ran in **one parallel batch — no serial-integration step** (cleaner
than A4). **Build clean (0 errors / 0 warnings), 2681 tests pass + 686 VisualQA** (was 1735 at A4 close; **+946** —
T5's per-map/model/shader theories + the T47/T59/T61 suites) — **independently re-verified**; the `--quit-after` and
dedicated `--host stormkeep --bots 2` smokes are both clean. Adversarial review (11 reviewers incl. a dedicated **T47
security auditor** + a **wire-check**, refute-by-default, every finding re-refuted): **12 confirmed (2 blockers / 6
major / 3 minor / 1 nit)** — **10 fixed, 2 deferred as tracked follow-ups** (not hacked as speculative dead wires).
**Security: clean** — the T47 audit found NO client-reachable admin verb. The recurring lesson held again: build +
2677 unit tests were green, yet the wire-check surfaced several T61 subsystems ported-but-dead on the live path.
- **T45** — warpzone **combat traversal**: `WarpZone_TraceBox/TraceLine/TraceToss` recursion (16-zone guard, RefSys
  accumulator) + `WarpZone_FindRadius` recursion, routed through `WeaponFiring` + `WeaponSplash.RadiusDamage` so
  hitscan/projectiles/splash cross seamless portals (non-warpzone maps stay byte-identical). **Residual:** the client
  **portal SubViewport render** is deferred (headless-unverifiable; portals still render opaque).
- **T47** — `SV_ParseClientCommand` 3-gate security filter (UTF-8 validation, ban enforcement, per-client flood
  bucket 8/1.0s) + the **server-only vs client-callable allowlist** so a connected client can no longer invoke
  `ban`/`kick`/`map`/`set`/`endmatch`/etc. **Review fix:** flood `<=`→`<` (DP-exact burst boundary).
- **T59** — 7 rare map entities (func_stardust, dynlight, trigger_viewlocation, misc_follow, func_fourier,
  func_vectormamamam, target_voicescript). **Review fix (major):** `VoiceScript.Next` was unwired → now pumped from
  `GameWorld.OnPlayerPostThink`. **Residuals:** dynlight emits no light (no dlight render system — T4), viewloc has no
  client camera consumer.
- **T61** — notification polish: announcer queue/dedup/spacing, deathtype `.message` category registry, MSG_CHOICE
  replication, StatusEffects bitmap codec, `_GlobalSound` VOICETYPE routing. **Review fixes:** **`_GlobalSound` was
  dead (blocker)** — `CmdVoice` now routes through `SoundSystem.GlobalSound` (team-radio/taunt gates + recipients);
  deathtype-category obituary now consulted; MSG_CHOICE **client→server** replication wired (gated). **Deferred
  (tracked):** remote-player StatusEffects net channel (no client overlay renderer exists — `task_bfd50c4f`),
  per-recipient MSG_CHOICE dispatch (`task_95b4dfe3`), monster/turret kill-site categorized-deathtype routing
  (`task_deedaac2`).
- **T68** — shownames player-nametag overlay (name + teammate health/armor bar, LOS/distance/team/overlap fade ramp);
  networked the entcs Armor slice. **T69** — HUD dynamic damage-shake (keyframe jitter, factor latch; confirmed Base
  has no directional nudge).
- **T29** — verified all 7 HUD panels faithful + **fixed** `hud_panel_quickmenu_time` 0→5; **review fix:** added a real
  `EngineInfoPanel` #13 (the FPS-overlay `FpsPanel` is a separate DP `Sbar_ShowFPS`).
- **T49** — single-player campaign **verified faithful end-to-end** (no code change; 23 flow tests). See
  [[campaign-flow-verified]].
- **T5** — visual QA scoped honestly: headless `VisualQaTests` (map load + model skeleton/bind-pose + shader-compile)
  in `ci.sh`; **windowed visual correctness needs a manual eye-check** (`tools/visual-qa.sh` + RUNNING.md) — headless
  renders blank.

**Carried residuals (documented):** T45 portal SubViewport render; T61 remote-StatusEffects net channel + per-recipient
MSG_CHOICE dispatch + monster/turret kill-site categorization (3 tracked follow-up tasks); T59 dynlight render + viewloc
client camera + path-travel; T5 windowed pixel verification (manual) + per-model boot flag (`task_9da7b4a6`).

**A6 next** (T55 server fidelity/Porto, T11c nade-throw input, T25 bot scripting+wpeditor, T32 GameTypeVote+mapvote
ballot, T60 admin/ops breadth, T70 admin/util cmd tail).

## 🔬 Parity re-audit (2026-06-07) — full QC↔port↔TODO sweep

An 18-subsystem fan-out (one auditor per QC area: weapons, gametypes, mutators×2, monsters, turrets, vehicles,
mapobjects, items, physics, effects/sounds/notify, minigames, client/HUD, menu, server-core, bot, commands, net/lib)
re-diffed **`Base/.../qcsrc` ↔ the port ↔ this file**, then **adversarially verified every "missing" claim**
(refute-by-default; **77 confirmed gaps + ~30 partials**, near-zero false positives). Headline:

> **The port is substantially more complete than T1–T34 implied** — all 20 gametypes, ~30 mutators, all
> monsters/turrets/vehicles, all 8 minigames, and the item/resource model are *ported*. The dominant gap is **not
> missing code but unwired runtime seams**: large, faithful subsystems that nothing on the live path calls — vehicles
> can't be boarded; bots never think; monster damage routes to `PlayerDamage`; the entire notification + sound registry
> is never *emitted*; minigame sessions are never created; world-item pickups are never *spawned*. The remainder is a
> content/breadth tail (map decoration/ambient/hazard entities, compat remaps, ~11 niche mutators) and client-feel
> features (hitsound, shownames, damagetext, announcer driver).

**New tasks added: T35–T61** (4×P0, 12×P1, 8×P2, 3×P3) — refs in the rows + the **§ Base/ source map** below. The
highest-value are the *dead-code-activation* seams: **T35** (item spawn/touch — *no pickups on any map today*), **T36**
(Assault/Nexball/Invasion/CTS objectives never spawn), **T37** (vehicles unboardable), **T38** (minigames unreachable),
**T39** (bot AI not ticked), **T40/T41** (combat feedback never emitted).

### TODO corrections (existing tasks)
- **T3** — claims it wired `PM_Physics` ("the headline dormant Call() site"); it did **not** — `PM_Physics`/`IsFlying`
  were conflated with `PlayerPhysics` and are absent (→ **T44**). The other 9 server hooks *are* wired.
- **T10** — ☑ but the **ITEMSTIME** panel has no server data feed (→ T51) and **MODICONS** feeds only tracked modes (→ T53).
- **T14** — accurate (spawnfuncs registered, NPCs idle-think), but the **monster damage→death** (→ T43) and **vehicle
  enter/input** (→ T37) seams sit between "spawned" and "playable" — NPCs/vehicles are not yet playable.
- **T19** — ☑ but **Overkill** weapons are name-only stubs (grant nothing) and `sv_doublejump` is simplified to an
  unconditional air-jump, losing the surface-gate + velocity-clip (→ T51).
- **T22** — ☑ for the logic-gate/`target_*`/door tail it claims, but its scope **omitted** the decoration/particle/
  weather/sound/laser/key/dynlight/viewloc/advanced-mover entities (→ T48/T59) and the `item_key` pickup side of the
  already-ported keylock (→ T35). Its source-map line (TODO ~646) is truncated mid-sentence.
- **T23** — should add the reorderable `cl_weaponpriority` list + a shared `DataSource` listbox; **move the language
  list (`languagelist.qc`) to T28** (it is i18n, not a data-list backend).
- **T25** — accurate; minor wording: `Bot/Waypoint.cs` already exists (parse/A*); T25 adds the editor-mutation +
  `waypoint_saveall` half, not a from-scratch file.
- **T29** — **omits the SCORE panel (#7)** (persistent on-HUD score/rank widget, on by default) — add it to the list.
- **T31** — broaden: the vehicle subsystem + the 8 minigame rule/AI engines carry comparable untested complexity but
  fall outside the current "parsers/builders/NPC" scope.

### Ported but previously untracked (the tables now reflect these are *done*, not gaps)
Faithful ports with **no T# attribution** before this audit — recorded so the tracker is honest: **all 12 untracked
gametypes** (Assault, ClanArena, FreezeTag, KeyHunt, Nexball, Invasion, Keepaway, TeamKeepaway, LMS, Survival, CTS,
Duel); the **Buffs** mutator; the **monster AI + 5 monsters**; the **vehicle** subsystem (ported, playable via T37); the
**8 minigame** rule engines + framework (ported, wired via T38); the **teamradar/RADAR** minimap; the **server
per-frame creature loop** (drown/contents/fall/regen); the **HavocBot AI body** (ported, ticked via T39); **effect +
notification net serialization**; and the **warpzone transform + teleport** core (combat traversal via T45).

| **T7** | ☑ | **[G] Wire gametype score columns + sort keys.** Each mode writes its `GameScores` columns; `SetPrimary/SetSecondary`. → *Scoreboard shows caps/ticks/laps and sorts per-mode.* | `src/.../Gameplay/GameTypes/*.cs`, `.../Scoring/GameScores.cs`, `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Scores.cs` | — |

| **T9** | ☑ | **[K] Scoreboard depth.** Configurable `sbt_field` columns + per-mode cols + accuracy grid + map info + respawn + rankings. **+ Client column networking:** T7 runs the per-mode `ScoreRules` server-side only, so the client registry stays at default labels — `ScoreboardBlock.LayoutHash` won't match once the snapshot loop calls `Serialize`. Network the active label/flags set (or a mode id the client maps to the same `ScoreRulesBasics`). | `game/hud/ScoreboardPanel.cs`, `src/XonoticGodot.Net/ScoreboardBlock.cs` | **T7** |
| **T10** | ☑ | **[K] Missing match-critical HUD panels.** MAPVOTE, MODICONS, RACETIMER, CHECKPOINTS, VOTE, ITEMSTIME, PHYSICS/speedo. | `game/hud/*` (new panels), `game/hud/HudManager.cs` | — |
| **T11** | ☑ | **[H] Powerup effects + Nades.** Wire strength(×dmg)/speed/invis(alpha) consumers; build the nades subsystem (throw + 9 types). | `src/.../Gameplay/Player/StatusEffects.cs`, `.../Damage/DamageSystem.cs`, `.../Physics/PlayerPhysics.cs`, new `.../Gameplay/Nades/*` | **T3** |
| **T12** | ☑ | **[I] Antilag breadth + connect polish.** Rewind monsters+nades; measured RTT; prediction reads replicated movevars. | `game/net/ServerNet.cs`, `src/XonoticGodot.Net/AntilagBuffer.cs`, `game/net/ClientNet.cs` | (validate after T1) |
| **T13** | ☑ | **[J] Deluxemap fix + hero-material table + `_reflect`/`_shirt`/`_pants`.** | `src/XonoticGodot.Formats/Bsp/BspReader.cs`, `game/MapLoader.cs`, `game/assets/{ShaderCompiler,AssetSystem}.cs` | — |

| **T15** | ☑ | **[L] Consume keybinds in gameplay + reconcile duplicate settings.** Wire the bind table into the controller; cvar store = single source of truth; quarantine legacy `MenuSettings`. | `game/PlayerController.cs`, `game/menu/{MenuSettings,SettingsScreen,KeyBindings}.cs` | (conflicts T4) |
| **T16** | ☑ | **[E] Headshot damage + per-weapon held-fire fidelity.** | `src/.../Gameplay/Weapons/{WeaponFiring,*}.cs`, `.../Damage/DamageSystem.cs` | **T2** |
| **T34** | ☑ | **[K] Reconcile the networked play-path presentation (T1↔T4 seam).** The menu "Start"/Create-Game/connect path runs through `game/net/NetGame.cs`, but T4's first-person feel was built into `GameDemo`/`PlayerController` (now reachable only via `--map`). Wired into NetGame so far: camera, the `*0.75` FOV, ViewEffects (damage-flash + liquid-tint), crosshair/health/radar. **Still missing on the real play path:** zoom (sample `InputButtons.Zoom` + apply to FOV), death/chase cam, the full HUD (weapon-bar/ammo/kill-feed/centerprint/announcer via `NotificationReceived`), and the first-person view-model/muzzle-flash. → *Factor a shared first-person-view component used by both `NetGame` and `GameDemo` (don't duplicate).* | `game/net/NetGame.cs`, `game/PlayerController.cs` (extract), `game/client/*`, `game/hud/*` | (after T10) |

| **T39** | ☑ | **[N] Wire HavocBot AI into the live `--host` loop.** `BotController`/`BotBrain.Think` (a complete `havocbot_ai` port) is never instantiated, so bots stand still — `--bots N` is inert. Construct a `BotController` in the server world, call `Frame()` each `StartFrame`, feed `WaypointNetwork.ForMap` on load, route the brain's input into the same movement/fire pipeline humans use; add danger detection (`havocbot_checkdanger` lava/slime/trigger_hurt/sky-edge), `navigation_unstuck`, and per-weapon `wr_aim` (bots never fire secondary today). Promotes the buried T33 prose note to a real task. QC `server/bot/default/{bot.qc,havocbot/havocbot.qc,navigation.qc}`. | `src/XonoticGodot.Server/{GameWorld,Bot/*}.cs`, `game/net/{NetGame,ServerNet}.cs` | (after T1) |
| **T40** | ☑ | **[K] Server combat-event emission (kill feed / centerprints / sounds / announcer).** The whole notification + sound registry is built but **never fired** in play — no kill feed, no frag/typefrag centerprint, no pain/death/impact sounds, no countdown/killstreak announcer. Port `Obituary()` message-selection (per-weapon `wr_killmessage`/`wr_suicidemessage` variants off the deathtype `HITTYPE` flags) + `Send_Notification(INFO/CENTER)`; emit pain/death/gasp/drown + armor/body-impact + gib player sounds at the damage/death sites; fire killstreak/multifrag/first-blood announcers + medals; emit warmup/round COUNTDOWN announcer + centerprint. QC `server/damage.qc Obituary`, `server/player.qc` (pain/impact), `common/weapons/weapon/*.qc wr_killmessage`, `notifications/all.inc`. | `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Scores.cs`, `src/.../Gameplay/Damage/DamageSystem.cs`, `.../Sounds/SoundSystem.cs`, `src/XonoticGodot.Server/WarmupController.cs`, `.../GameTypes/*` | — |
| **T41** | ☑ | **[K] Client feedback drivers (hitsound / footsteps / announcer / rings).** Client-derived feel cues are absent: `cl_hitsound` hit-confirm beep (needs a networked damage-dealt-total stat + `view.qc HitSound`), footstep/landing sounds (`PM_Footsteps`/`PM_check_hitground` in movement), the clock-driven announcer countdown VOICE (`announcer.qc` → 3-2-1 / prepare / N-min-remaining from `GAMESTARTTIME`/`ROUNDSTARTTIME`/`TIMELIMIT`), and the objective crosshair rings (`STAT(NADE_TIMER)`/`CAPTURE_PROGRESS`/`REVIVE_PROGRESS`). QC `client/view.qc HitSound`+`HUD_Draw`, `client/announcer.qc`, `common/physics/player.qc PM_Footsteps`. | `game/client/*`, `game/hud/{HudNotifications,CrosshairPanel}.cs`, `game/net/NetGame.cs`, `src/.../Physics/PlayerPhysics.cs` | (after T40) |
| **T42** | ☑ | **[G] Global overtime / sudden-death win layer (`CheckRules_World`).** Score modes latch `MatchEnded` on their frag/point limit only; a tied timed DM/TDM/CTF/Dom/KH ends in a **draw** instead of overtime/sudden-death, and `leadlimit` + the "N frags remaining" announcer are absent. Port `InitiateSuddenDeath`/`InitiateOvertime`/`checkrules_suddendeathend` + `timelimit_overtime[s]`/`timelimit_suddendeath`/`leadlimit` into a shared win-condition driver; score modes report tie/equality. QC `server/world.qc` (`CheckRules_World`:1725, `InitiateSuddenDeath`:1467, `InitiateOvertime`:1499, `WinningCondition_Scores`:1560). | `src/XonoticGodot.Server/GameWorld.cs`, `.../Gameplay/GameTypes/*.cs` | — |
| **T43** | ☑ | **[P] Monster damage→pain/death seam + reset.** `MonsterAI.MarkPain`/`MarkDead` are fully written but have **zero callers** — a monster victim falls through `DamageSystem.EventDamage` to `PlayerDamage`, so no monster pain/anim/sound, no loot drop, no gib threshold, no corpse/respawn, no `MonsterDies` hook, no `Monster_Heal` (Mage can't heal). Install a monster `event_damage` shim (armor-split → `mr_pain` → `MarkPain`/`MarkDead`); add `Monster_Reset` on round restart (deferred by T14); maintain global `monsters_total`/`monsters_killed` stats; `mr_deadthink`. QC `common/monsters/sv_monsters.qc` (`Monster_Damage`:1083, `Monster_Dead`:1036, `Monster_Reset`:999). | `src/.../Gameplay/Monsters/MonsterAI.cs`, `.../Damage/DamageSystem.cs`, `game/hud/ScoreboardPanel.cs` | (after T14) |
| **T44** | ☑ | **[H] Physics override hooks + spectator free-flight.** Two QC movement-tick mutator hooks are missing: `PM_Physics` (return-true fully replaces the move — **T3 claims this was wired but it was not**) and `IsFlying` (force the fly branch). Also observers are frozen at world origin — port the `!IS_PLAYER` branch `sys_phys_spectator_control` + `SPECTATORSPEED` impulse speed-ladder so spectators fly. `PM_Physics` unblocks bugrigs (T51). QC `ecs/systems/physics.qc:108/113`, `ecs/systems/sv_physics.qc:67`. | `src/.../Physics/PlayerPhysics.cs`, `.../Gameplay/Mutators/MutatorHooks.cs`, `game/net/ServerNet.cs` | — |
| **T45** | ☑ | **[I] Warpzone combat traversal + portal rendering.** The transform/teleport half is ported (you can walk through), but no trace recurses through zones, so on warpzone maps hitscan/projectiles/splash stop at the portal surface and the portal renders opaque. Port `WarpZone_TraceBox`/`TraceLine`/`TraceToss_ThroughZone` + `WarpZone_FindRadius` (+ RefSys/accumulator) into a `TraceService` extension and route `WeaponFiring`/`MoveTypePhysics`/`DamageSystem.RadiusDamage` through it; client portal render (Godot `SubViewport`) + `FixNearClip` + `View_Inside` + teleported view/input rotate. QC `lib/warpzone/{common,client,server}.qc`. | `src/XonoticGodot.Engine/Collision/*`, `.../MapObjects/Warpzone.cs`, `.../Weapons/WeaponFiring.cs`, `.../Damage/DamageSystem.cs`, `game/net/NetGame.cs` | — |
| **T46** | ☑ | **[L] Server chat engine (team/private/ignore/flood).** Only a raw `say` (broadcast-to-all, `teamOnly` hardcoded false) exists; `say_team`, `tell`, `ignore`/`unignore`/`clear_ignores`, per-say flood control, `g_chat_*` gates, magicear, and `formatmessage()` macros (`%d`/`%h`/`%l`) are absent — `say_team` is match-critical team feel. Port `server/chat.qc Say()` + register the cmds. QC `server/chat.qc`, `server/command/cmd.qc` (`say_team`/`tell`/`ignore`). | `src/XonoticGodot.Server/{Commands,Chat}.cs`, `game/net/ServerNet.cs` | — |
| **T47** | ☑ | **[I] Harden the client command bus (security).** `ServerNet.HandleClientCommand` runs **any** command name through the same table the server console uses — a connected client can invoke `ban`/`kick`/`gotomap`/`endmatch`/`settemp`. Add the QC `SV_ParseClientCommand` gate: per-client flood control (`sv_clientcommand_antispam_*`), UTF-8 validation, ban enforcement, and a server-only vs client-callable registry split (`reg.qh`). QC `server/command/cmd.qc SV_ParseClientCommand`, `server/command/reg.qh`. | `game/net/ServerNet.cs`, `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Commands.cs` | — |
| **T48** | ☑ | **[O] Map-entity content tail (hazard / props / ambient / music).** A swath of common map entities silently no-op: `misc_laser` (continuous-damage / detector beam — a real hazard), `misc_gamemodel`/`misc_models`/`misc_clientmodel` + dynamic `func_static`/`func_wall`/`func_illusionary`/`func_clientwall` (external decoration models — most stock maps have several, invisible today), `func_pointparticles`/`func_sparks` (ambient particles), `func_rain`/`func_snow` (weather), `target_speaker` (ambient/triggered sound), `target_music`/`trigger_music` (in-game map music). QC `common/mapobjects/{misc/laser.qc,models.qc,func/pointparticles.qc,func/rainsnow.qc,target/speaker.qc,target/music.qc}`. | `src/.../Gameplay/MapObjects/*`, `game/client/*`, `game/assets/models/*` | (after T20) |
| **T49** | ☑ | **[L] Single-player campaign wiring.** `SingleplayerScreen` ships a static 6-level array and the faithful `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Campaign.cs` core has **zero callers** — the campaign is non-functional end-to-end. Port `XonoticCampaignList` (read `maps/campaign*.txt` via `CampaignFile_Load`, track `g_campaign<name>_index`, render unlocked/current/future rows with checkmark + map preview + gametype icon, gate future levels, multi-campaign Next/Prev) and connect it to `Campaign.cs` so `CampaignSetup` boots the level. QC `menu/xonotic/campaign.qc`, `menu/xonotic/dialog_singleplayer.qc`, `common/campaign_file.qc`. | `game/menu/SingleplayerScreen.cs`, `src/XonoticGodot.Server/{Campaign,GameWorld}.cs` | — |
| **T50** | ☑ | **[L] Menu command dispatch + game menu + visual pickers.** `MenuCommand.Dispatch` ignores `directmenu`/`nexposee`/`closemenu`/`menu_show*` (bound buttons that open Servers/Profile/Settings/Guide/HUD-editor log inert); the ESC `PauseMenu` lacks Join!/Spectate (the only menu path to enter/leave the match), Leave-match, and Quick-menu; and the crosshair picker, 3D player-model preview, charmap, colorpicker, and reorderable `cl_weaponpriority` list are downgraded to text/number stand-ins. Port a by-name dialog registry + the gamemenu buttons + the picker widgets + a shared `DataSource` listbox. QC `menu/command/menu_cmd.qc`, `menu/xonotic/{dialog_gamemenu,crosshairpicker,playermodel,charmap,colorpicker,weaponslist,datasource}.qc`. | `game/menu/framework/*`, `game/menu/{PauseMenu,SingleplayerScreen}.cs`, `game/menu/dialogs/*` | — |
| **T66** | ☑ | **[item] Fire the `FilterItem` item-spawn hook.** `MutatorHooks.FilterItemDefinition` has **6 live subscribers** (Mayhem/TeamMayhem/Duel/HookMutator/MeleeOnly/NIX) but the chain is **never called** on world-item spawn (`StartItem.cs:78` proceeds unconditionally), so their item-filtering is dead code — **NIX still spawns every map item**, Duel doesn't block powerups, MeleeOnly doesn't strip health/armor, Mayhem/TeamMayhem powerup filter + Hook world-pickup suppress are inert. Fire the chain in `StartItem.SpawnInternal` *before* the have-pickup-item gate and abort+`delete` the spawn when it returns true (QC `startitem_failed`). Add a regression test (NIX strips a spawned `item_health`). *(Audit 2026-06-12.)* QC `server/items/items.qc:1031` (`if(MUTATOR_CALLHOOK(FilterItem, this))`). | `src/.../Gameplay/Items/StartItem.cs` | (after T35) |

| **T24** | ☑ | **[J] MDL importer (2026-07).** MDL is real loaded content: `casing_shell`/`casing_steel`/`gibs/chunk` are genuine Quake1 MDLs that spammed "not a known model" every boot and rendered only a placeholder. `MdlReader` (palette-decoded skin via embedded `host_quakepal` + anorms normals) + `MdlBuilder` (shared static mesh), dispatched by `AssetLoader.BuildModelFactory`. Guarded by `ModelImporterCoverageTests` + `MdlReaderTests` + the `VisualQaTests` MDL sweep. **⚠ The earlier "MDL/MD2/ZYM/PSK formally cut" decision was a mistake (not deliberately chosen) — reverted; the remaining MD2/ZYM/PSK importers are open work → see T72.** | `src/XonoticGodot.Formats/Mdl/*`, `game/loaders/{AssetLoader,models/MdlBuilder}.cs`, `tests/*` | — |
| **T72** | ☐ | **[J] MD2 / ZYM / PSK model importers (not yet implemented).** `AssetLoader.BuildModelFactory` dispatches by magic and implements IQM/DPM/MD3/MDL; MD2 (`IDP2`), ZYM (`ZYMOTICMODEL`), PSK (`ACTRHEAD`) fall through to null + a placeholder + a boot-log error (previously mislabeled a deliberate "formal cut" — reverted). **Content impact:** **ZYM** (DP `Mod_ZYMOTICMODEL_Load`, `model_alias.c`) — 2 real map props (`models/pomp/pomp.zym`, `models/train.zym` in the maps pk3) render as placeholders → port to make them show (*medium pri*); **MD2** (`Mod_IDP2_Load`) / **PSK** (`Mod_PSKMODEL_Load`) — no shipped Base content, mod/custom-map compat only (*low pri*). Mirror the MDL importer shape (`src/XonoticGodot.Formats/Mdl/` + `game/loaders/models/MdlBuilder.cs`). | `src/XonoticGodot.Formats/{Md2,Zym,Psk}/*`, `game/loaders/{AssetLoader,models/*}.cs`, `tests/*` | — |
| **T73** | ☐ | **[K] Real MDL models for legacy projectiles/props (opportunity, low-pri).** Now that MDL loads, the genuine projectile/prop MDLs (`plasma.mdl`, `rocketmissile.mdl`, `hagarmissile.mdl`, `spike.mdl`, `bullet.mdl`, `laser_dot.mdl`, `runematch/{rune,curse}.mdl`, `beam.mdl`) — currently drawn as `BodyFamily.GlowSprite`/procedural bodies in `ProjectileCatalog` — *could* use their real models. DP renders several of these as glow sprites too, so it's a per-projectile fidelity **judgement vs Base**, not a clear win; no regression today (those paths aren't loaded). | `game/client/{ProjectileCatalog,ProjectileRenderer}.cs` | — |
| **T74** | ☐ | **[J] Load-screen roster-warm alloc storm (~230MB main-thread frame).** The last deterministic single-frame allocation storm (byte-identical ~230MB in every 2026-07-03 stormkeep capture — `_scratch/perf_{sk_st0,parsepool,parsepool2,decodepool*}.json`, t≈4.4s, 2×gen2 + ~56ms GC pause; pins 0.1%low at 7fps every run). Cause: `PrecacheCombatSoundsAndModelsAsync` (`game/net/NetGame.cs` ~2201) warms the player roster via **synchronous main-thread `LoadSkeletalModel`, yielding only between models** — one frame carries a whole model's read+parse+anim-build+mesh (`iqm.mesh` scope-total 235ms > the 147ms frame span). The worker side is already fixed (IQM parse pooling + shared decode pool + bounded streamer lane, d7db8c9) — route the roster warm through that same lane (`ParseSkeletalModel` off-thread → `BuildSkeletalModel` under the streamer's main-thread budget), or slice the warm finer than per-model. ⚠ Validate via the perf report's **alloc-storm list**, not hitch trees — load-screen frames (t<~13s) write no hitch trees to the session log; and A/B with two runs (spawn-lottery fps noise, see PERF-DEBUGGING.md). | `game/net/NetGame.cs`, `game/client/BackgroundAssetStreamer.cs`, `game/loaders/AssetLoader.cs` | — |
| **T25** | ☐ | **[N] Bot scripting (`bot_cmd`)** + waypoint-editor commands. | new `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Bot/*`, `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Commands.cs` | — |
| **T26** | ☑ | **[A] Activate the source generator** (or delete it): move analyzer ref to `XonoticGodot.Common.csproj`, cover Monster/Turret/Vehicle + catalogs, swap `Bootstrap()`→`RegisterAll()`. | `src/XonoticGodot.SourceGen/*`, `XonoticGodot.Common.csproj`, `src/.../GameInit.cs`, `.../Registries.cs` | — |
| **T51** | ☑ | **[H] Remaining mutators (wave 2) + Overkill weapons + doublejump fix.** Unported registered mutators: `hook` (`g_grappling_hook` spawn-with-offhand-grapple — a dead menu toggle today, **P1**), `damagetext` (floating damage numbers sv+cl, **P1**), `itemstime` backend (server `it_times[]` feed for the ITEMSTIME panel, which renders empty), `bugrigs` (needs T44 `PM_Physics`), `breakablehook`, `campcheck`, `kick_teamkiller`, `dynamic_handicap` (+ wire the inert basic handicap), `superspec`, `sandbox` (the `DialogSandboxTools` menu is dead). Plus: implement the 5 **Overkill** weapon classes (`okmachinegun`/`oknex`/`okshotgun`/`okhmg`/`okrpc` — referenced by name but resolve to null, so g_overkill grants nothing) and fix `sv_doublejump` (currently unconditional air-jump; QC needs the surface tracebox + velocity-clip). QC `common/mutators/mutator/{hook,damagetext,itemstime,bugrigs,breakablehook,campcheck,kick_teamkiller,dynamic_handicap,superspec,sandbox,doublejump,overkill}/*`. | new `src/.../Gameplay/Mutators/*`, `.../Weapons/*`, `game/client/*` | **T3**, T44 (bugrigs) |
| **T52** | ☑ | **[O] Compat entity remaps (Q3/QL/CPMA/Q1/WoP/Q3DF).** Only the entity-*removal* filter is ported; the *add* side is absent, so every weapon/item/armor/powerup on an imported Quake3/QuakeLive/CPMA/DeFRaG/Quake1/WoP map is an unhandled classname (geometry loads, no pickups). Port `SPAWNFUNC_Q3`/`WEAPON`/`ITEM` remaps (`weapon_railgun`→Vortex, `item_quad`→Strength, … + ammo `.count` scaling + SG↔MG arena swap) and the Q3DF `target_init`/`target_score`/`target_fragsFilter`/`target_print`. Depends on T35. QC `server/compat/{quake3,quake2,quake,wop}.qc`. | `.../MapObjects/MapObjectsRegistry.cs`, new `.../MapObjects/CompatRemaps.cs` | **T35** |
| **T53** | ☑ | **[G] Round/objective HUD stats for untracked modes.** The per-team alive counts (`REDALIVE`/`BLUEALIVE`/…), the `eliminatedPlayers` networked entity, KH `OBJECTIVE_STATUS`, and the Survival hunter-status entity exist only as comments, so MODICONS/spectator HUD won't reflect CA/FreezeTag/KeyHunt/Survival live state (T10's MODICONS feeds only tracked modes). Network these stats → `ModIconsPanel`.

| **T54** | ☑ | **[I] Movement/prediction breadth.** Only 8 of ~44 `MOVEVARS_*` stats are replicated, so a remote client whose cvars differ from the server (or any non-default air/aircontrol/warsowbunny/jumpspeedcap server) mispredicts/rubber-bands; per-client physics presets (`g_physics_clientselect` xonotic/nexuiz/cpma/xdf/…) and the `sentcvar`/`sendcvar` client-cvar replication (`cl_weaponpriority`/`cl_autoswitch`/`cl_noantilag`) are also absent (so server-side priority weapon-cycling has no client order).

| **T55** | ☐ | **[O] Server-core fidelity gaps.** Forced teams (`g_forced_team_*` + `Player_GetForcedTeamIndex`) + the `sv_teamnagger` warmup nag are deferred (deterministic team setups + forced-spectator broken); the Porto in/out-portal placement + connected-pair teleport is unwired (`Porto.PortalSpawner`/`SpawnPortalAsWarpzone` have no caller); fall damage ignores active-grapple immunity + the `NODAMAGE` floor surface; lava doesn't ignite (`lava_burn`) and projectiles aren't damaged by lava/slime contents. QC `server/teamplay.qc`, `server/portals.qc`, `server/main.qc CreatureFrame_*`. | `src/XonoticGodot.Server/{Teamplay,PlayerFrameLogic}.cs`, `.../Weapons/Porto.cs`, `.../MapObjects/Warpzone.cs` | — |
| **T56** | ☑ | **[M] Generic + client + reply command parity.** Mostly-unported command families: `rpn` (the RPN-calculator VM stock cfgs/quickmenu rely on), `maplist add/cleanup/remove/shuffle`, `addtolist`/`removefromlist`, `qc_curl` (`generic.qc`); the client verbs `voice` (taunts), `suggestmap`, `physics`, `autoswitch`, `clientversion`; `defer <s> <cmd>`/`defer clear` (so passed `restart` votes actually fire); reply verbs `records`/`rankings`/`lsmaps`/`printmaplist`/`ladder` + `cvar_purechanges`; `editmob`/`spawnmob`/`killmob` (so the ported Monster-Tools dialog works). QC `common/command/{generic,rpn}.qc`, `server/command/{cmd,sv_cmd,common,getreplies}.qc`. | `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Commands.cs`, `src/XonoticGodot.Engine/Console/ConsoleCommands.cs` | — |
| **T57** | ☑ | **[E] Weapon tail.** `W_ThrowWeapon` (drop/throw current weapon, impulse 17 — recognised but no-op; also blocks pinata/on-death loot being collectable); per-shot/per-damage **accuracy** tracking (`accuracy_add` fired/hit/real → scoreboard accuracy% + XonStat read 0 today; `WeaponAccuracy` exists but is called only on kill-credit); per-weapon secondary depth (e.g. Vortex `chargepool` + velocity-charge `GetPressedKeys` hook + forced-reload).

## ⚪ P3 — Long tail & polish

| **T61** | ☑ | **[K] Feedback / notification polish.** Announcer queue + same-sample dedup + queuetime spacing (`Local_Notification_Queue_Process` — voices currently stomp); deathtypes as a registry with `.message` category (monster/turret/vehicle obituary phrasing + `DEATH_IS*`); `MSG_CHOICE` per-client cvar replication (verbose/terse frag messages); `status_effects` client networking (`StatusEffects_update` for burning/frozen overlays); voice-message/taunt routing (`_GlobalSound` VOICETYPE team-fan/taunt-anim/autotaunt/last-attacker).

| **T71** | ☐ | **[K] Client-prediction / view-feel long tail** (2026-06-10 — the rest after projectile prediction + view-punch + hitmarker landed). **(a) View bob** — the whole camera bobbing on walk/run (`cl_bob*`, `qcsrc/client/view.qc`); the port bobs the *weapon model* but not the camera. **(b) Velocity zoom** — FOV widening with movement speed (`cl_velocityzoom`, `view.qc:GetCurrentFov`). **(c) Local movement-sound prediction** — footstep/jump/land played on the *predicting* client for immediacy. ⚠ Both Base and the port emit these server-authoritatively; on a listen server the authoritative tick already plays them immediately, so local prediction only helps a *pure remote client* (still a flat-floor stub) and would **double** the sound on `--host` — so this is **blocked on remote-client map replication**, not a standalone task. **(d) Gravity-bounce projectile prediction** — extend `ProjectilePredictor` with client-side gravity so grenade/mine/electro/hookbomb (`MOVETYPE_TOSS/BOUNCE`) get arc+bounce prediction too (today they're straight + snapshot-corrected `CollisionMode.None`); the gravity-free Stop/Bounce types already predict. **(e) Recoil for the remaining weapons** — overkill HMG/MG/Nex/RPC/Shotgun + vaporizer secondary still pass `recoil:0` to `SetupShot` (standard arsenal is wired). | `game/client/{FirstPersonView,ProjectileRenderer}.cs`, `src/XonoticGodot.Net/ProjectilePredictor.cs`, `src/.../Physics/PlayerPhysics.cs`, overkill weapons | (c) after remote-client collision |
| **T69** | ☑ | **[K] HUD dynamic shake on damage/event.** `hud_dynamic_shake`/`_*` are menu cvars with **no runtime** — the whole-HUD jitter on damage (and the damage-direction nudge) never plays. Port `HUD_Dynamic_Shake` (the damage-keyed offset/rotation applied to the HUD root). *(Audit 2026-06-12.)* QC `client/hud/hud.qc` (`HUD_Dynamic_Shake`). | `game/hud/HudManager.cs`, `game/hud/*` | (after T41) |

## Suggested parallel waves (recompute from `Touches` each dispatch)

Illustrative — the orchestrator should re-derive disjoint, unblocked sets at dispatch time.

**✅ Completed:** **Wave 1** (T1·T2·T4·T7·T13·T20) · **Wave 2** (T3·T6·T8·T10·T12·T14·T21) · **Wave 3**

[§ Wave-1 fidelity audit](#-wave-1-fidelity-audit-2026-06-06--vs-base-source).

### Forward plan A1–A6 (open tasks: T5, T23–T33, T35–T61, T62–T71, carried T11c/T19c) — re-audit 2026-06-07; +T66–T71 from the 2026-06-12 audit

> **Parity-first (applies to every A-wave task):** start by reading the task's **§ Base/ source map** entry + the cited
> Base file(s) to confirm *exactly* how the feature behaves, then port it (see the mandatory protocol at the top of this
> file). Especially load-bearing here because most A-wave tasks *wire up already-ported code* — the agent must check the
> Base call-site/order to wire it faithfully, not just call the existing method.

**Model.** Within a wave no two tasks edit the same hot file's *logic*; registration tables
(`MapObjectsRegistry.RegisterAll`, `Registries`, per-mode `GameTypes/*`) are **additive-coordinated** (agents add
disjoint entries, orchestrator integrates — as Waves 1–3 did). Four chokepoints are held to **≤1 task/wave**:
`GameWorld.cs` (T35/36/39/42/49), the `DamageSystem.cs` damage pipeline (T40/43/45/57), `NetGame.cs` (T37/39/41/45),
and `Commands.cs`+`VoteController.cs` (T38/46/47/54/56/25/32/60 — the worst, 8 tasks).

> **A0 — optional decongestion (high leverage).** Split `GameWorld.cs`, `Commands.cs`, `MapObjectsRegistry.cs` into
> per-domain `partial class` files (no behavior change — the "consider splitting it" note in the conflict map). Removes
> the ≤1/wave limit on those files and lets the A6 command tail run fully parallel.

**Playable-from-menu** is reached after **A1+A2** (all P0 T35–T38 + the highest-impact P1 activations) — pickups,
combat feedback, working bots/NPCs, and objective win paths on stock maps. A3–A4 = faithful feel + breadth; A5–A6 =
polish, security, long tail. Dependency edges honored: T41/T61←T40, T52/T57←T35, T51-bugrigs←T44, T59←T48, T55-Porto←T45.

**Demo replay & video capture (T62–T65)** is an **independent track** that sidesteps the A-waves' chokepoint model —
its `Touches` are mostly *new* files (`DemoFormat`/`DemoRecorder`/`DemoPlayback`/`SpectatorCamera`/`VideoCaptureHook`)
with thin seams in `ServerNet`/`NetGame`/`DialogMediaDemo`. Run it as its own mini-wave in the documented order
(T62 → T63 → T65 ∥ T64); see the two demo specs and the
[§ Demo replay & video-capture track](#-demo-replay--video-capture-track-t62t65) note above.

## 🔎 Wave-1 fidelity audit (2026-06-06) — vs Base source

Each Wave-1 task was re-audited against its Base source above (independent verify → adversarial confirm, refute-by-
default). **All headline design claims hold and there are 0 blockers** — the architecture is faithful. But the confirm
pass validated **42 real fidelity gaps** (11 major / 24 minor / 7 nit). Majors that affect the *normal* play path are
remediation candidates; structural ones are folded into the tasks noted. Severity is the post-confirm re-rating.

> **✅ REMEDIATED (2026-06-06).** All 42 gaps were fixed via a 6-agent fan-out (35 done / 3 partial / 0 skipped on the
> first pass), then an adversarial review of the edits found 13 follow-on issues (2 major / 10 minor / 1 nit) — 11
> fixed, 1 left as a documented simplification. Build clean, **264 tests pass**, and the play path verified headless
> (`--host atelier --bots 2`, no-net `--map`, listen-server connect). **Partials carried forward (NOT fully closed):**
> (1) **A2** — frozen-fire gate covers the reachable freeze case; `player_blocked` / round-not-started / `ForbidWeaponUse`
> need server-side round_handler state (→ T3/round modes). (2) **D1** — two-slot team scoring migrated CTF/Dom/KH/TDM;
> ClanArena/FreezeTag/TeamKeepaway/Nexball/Onslaught/Assault still on private dicts (→ T9 / their mode tasks). (3) **E1** —
> deluxe angle-rescale done; the `dot(N,lightdir)` bump term needs mesh tangents (→ T13 follow-up). Left as documented
> simplification: **A4** Crylink dead-group head re-seat. Out-of-scope perf note: headless bot AI was ~0.46s/frame/2-bots
> (navigation/tracewalk) — **root-caused + fixed in T33's perf pass** (see T33 notes): the shipped
> `.waypoints`/`.cache` parsed to **zero** nodes (vtos single-quote vector literals weren't stripped) so every bot
> fell back to the ~219ms O(N²) AutoLink tracewalk graph build; fixing the parser + completing `ForMap` (load the
> precompiled link cache instead of AutoLink) + a sort/early-exit `Nearest` (29×) + pooled A* buffers drops the bot
> think to ~0.04 ms/bot/tick and the graph build to ~8 ms. (AI think itself is not yet wired into the live
> `--host` server loop — see T33.)

### T1-netcode-ui-audit — minor-gaps — 5 confirmed (1 major)
- **[major]** Clients connect straight into play — Xonotic's connect-as-Observer/Join phase is skipped
  - base `qcsrc/server/client.qc:ClientConnect` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Server/ClientManager.cs:159`
  - In Base, ClientConnect ENDS by transmuting the new client to Observer (a spectator); a human only becomes a live Player by explicitly Join-ing (ObserverOrSpectatorThink: press jump/fire → TRANSMUTE(Player)+PutClientInServer; bots auto-join via autojoin_checked). The port's ClientManager.ClientConnect unconditionally c…
- **[minor]** Debug print leftovers ship on the spawn + net play paths (stdout spam every spawn / 2x per second)
  - base `qcsrc/server/client.qc:PutPlayerInServer` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Player/SpawnSystem.cs:151`
  - Three TEMP-DEBUG blocks are unconditional (no #if DEBUG / autocvar gate) and run on the shipping net/listen-server path. SpawnSystem.SelectSpawnPoint prints every gathered spawn entity ([DBG-SPOT]) on EVERY spawn selection, and PutPlayerInServer prints [DBG-SPAWN] on every (re)spawn — both via Console.WriteLine. NetGa…
- **[minor]** Wish-move scaled by a hardcoded 360, not live sv_maxspeed — caps true top speed when sv_maxspeed > 360
  - base `qcsrc/server/client.qc:PutPlayerInServer` → port `XonoticGodot/game/net/EntityMovementStep.cs:43`
  - Both the client predictor (EntityMovementStep) and the server input converter (ServerNet.ToMovementInput) rescale the normalized ±1 wish-move by MovementParameters.Defaults.MaxSpeed (a hardcoded 360), while the actual movement reads the LIVE sv_maxspeed via MovementParameters.FromCvars() each tick and clamps wishspeed…
- **[minor]** QC ClientConnect/ClientDisconnect player-visible side-effects absent on the net path
  - base `qcsrc/server/client.qc:ClientDisconnect` → port `XonoticGodot/game/net/ServerNet.cs:350`
  - Several QC connect/disconnect effects a player would notice are not reproduced. (a) Base ClientDisconnect emits Send_Effect(EFFECT_SPAWN, this.origin, ...) — the teleport-out particle puff when a player leaves — and Send_Notification(INFO_QUIT_DISCONNECT); the port's ServerNet.OnPeerDisconnected → ClientManager.Client…
- **[nit]** Listen server spawns the human's authoritative Player only on ENet accept; the prediction carrier sits at world origin until the first snapshot
  - base `qcsrc/server/client.qc:PutClientInServer` → port `XonoticGodot/game/net/NetGame.cs:304`
  - On a listen server there are two representations of the local human: the authoritative Player (created server-side in ServerNet.HandleAuth → ClientManager.ClientConnect, only after the async ENet+auth handshake completes) and the client-side prediction carrier (NetGame.SpawnCarrier, 'client_predict', SOLID_NOT). The c…

### T2-weapon-fire-driver — major-gaps — 8 confirmed (5 major)
- **[major]** Firing does not remove the spawn shield (weapon_prepareattack_do drops STATUSEFFECT_SpawnShield)
  - base `qcsrc/server/weapons/weaponsystem.qc:weapon_prepareattack_do` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Weapons/WeaponFireGate.cs:88-91`
  - QC clears the spawn shield the instant a player fires, so you cannot shoot from behind spawn protection. The port's PrepareAttack deliberately skips this, asserting the spawn-shield system handles it — but the only remover (RemoveSpawnShield) is private to DamageSystem and is never invoked on the fire path. Net effect…
- **[major]** Frozen / player_blocked players can still fire (weaponLocked not enforced on the weapon path)
  - base `qcsrc/server/weapons/weaponsystem.qc:W_WeaponFrame (weaponLocked)` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Server/GameWorld.cs:693-705`
  - QC W_WeaponFrame calls weaponLocked() (true when StatusEffects_active(STATUSEFFECT_Frozen) or player.player_blocked, etc.) and, if locked and state!=WS_CLEAR, only calls w_ready (no fire). The port runs the entire WeaponFireDriver.Frame whenever `!gameStopped && !p.IsDead`, with no frozen/player_blocked gate. The move…
- **[major]** Electro secondary fires all orbs at once instead of one-per-frame via W_Electro_CheckAttack
  - base `qcsrc/common/weapons/weapon/electro.qc:wr_think (fire & 2) + W_Electro_CheckAttack` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Weapons/Electro.cs:143-148`
  - QC fires the first orb, sets electro_count = count, and schedules W_Electro_CheckAttack which fires the remaining (count-1) orbs on successive held ticks (each --electro_count, re-scheduled by animtime) — a stream of orbs while the button is held. The port fires all `count` orbs in a single instant from one origin/aim…
- **[major]** Crylink link-join converges on a fixed timer, not on button release (loses the weapon's core mechanic)
  - base `qcsrc/common/weapons/weapon/crylink.qc:wr_think (crylink_waitrelease release branch)` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Weapons/Crylink.cs:129-143`
  - The Crylink's defining behavior (per its own in-game description) is: hold fire → spikes spread; RELEASE → they converge (W_Crylink_LinkJoin) for burst damage at a moment the player chooses. QC triggers the join on `crylink_waitrelease==1 && !(fire & 1)` (the release edge). The port instead converges automatically onc…
- **[major]** Shotgun primary/secondary share ATTACK_FINISHED — melee can no longer follow a blast immediately
  - base `qcsrc/common/weapons/weapon/shotgun.qc:wr_think (shotgun_primarytime)` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Weapons/Shotgun.cs:101-128`
  - QC deliberately keeps the shotgun primary refire on a SEPARATE field (shotgun_primarytime) and passes only animtime as the attacktime into weapon_prepareattack, with the explicit comment 'handle refire separately so the secondary can be fired straight after a primary'. So ATTACK_FINISHED moves only by the short animti…
- **[minor]** MachineGun secondary burst fires all rounds in one instant instead of spacing them by burst_refire
  - base `qcsrc/common/weapons/weapon/machinegun.qc:W_MachineGun_Attack_Burst` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Weapons/Machinegun.cs:178-199`
  - QC fires ONE burst round, then self-reschedules weapon_thinkf(..., burst_refire, W_MachineGun_Attack_Burst) so the `burst` rounds leave the barrel ~0.06s apart (with aim drift between them), and only after misc_bulletcounter counts up to 0 does it apply burst_refire2 (0.45s) and return to ready. The port fires the ent…
- **[minor]** Per-weapon cross-mode refire interlocks dropped (electro_secondarytime+refire2; shotgun_primarytime)
  - base `qcsrc/common/weapons/weapon/electro.qc:wr_think (electro_secondarytime gates)` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Weapons/Electro.cs:130-150`
  - QC Electro gates the PRIMARY bolt on `time >= electro_secondarytime + refire2` (and secondary on `+ refire`), so you cannot instantly bolt right after lobbing orbs (and vice versa). The port has no electro_secondarytime field/logic; primary and secondary are independently refire-gated, allowing a faster bolt-after-orb…
- **[minor]** MachineGun sustained spread ignores the crouch spread modifier
  - base `qcsrc/common/weapons/weapon/machinegun.qc:W_MachineGun_Attack_Auto` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Weapons/Machinegun.cs:155-175`
  - QC multiplies the sustained-fire spread_accuracy by spread_crouchmod when the player is ducked and on the ground (tighter spread while crouched). The port's AttackAuto computes spread = spread_min ± accum and never applies the crouch modifier (SpreadCrouchmod is read into Cvars but only the legacy decay path uses the …

### T4-view-camera — major-gaps — 11 confirmed (1 major)
- **[major]** Zoom default magnitude wrong: cl_zoomfactor fallback AND seeded value 2.5 vs Base default 5
  - base `data/xonotic-client.cfg:59 (view.qc:GetCurrentFov line 501-503)` → port `XonoticGodot/game/PlayerController.cs:179,328-329`
  - GetCurrentFov reads autocvar_cl_zoomfactor with an in-code clamp default of 2.5 ONLY when out of [1,30]; Base's actual cvar default is 5. The port not only falls back to 2.5 (UpdateZoom) but actively seeds the cvar to "2.5" via Cvars.Register in _Ready — so even when the value IS set it is set wrong. A full +zoom reac…
- **[minor]** Damage flash ~5x too strong: hud_damage_factor fallback 0.13 vs Base default 0.025
  - base `data/_hud_common.cfg:303 (read by view.qc:HUD_Damage line ~1254)` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/ViewEffects.cs:58`
  - view.qc computes myhealth_flash += dmg_take * autocvar_hud_damage_factor. Base's shipped default for hud_damage_factor is 0.025. The port hardcodes the fallback at 0.13 — ~5.2x larger — so every hit produces a vastly stronger red flash than Base whenever the cvar is unset (standalone/headless GameDemo, where no cfg po…
- **[minor]** hud_damage master multiplier fallback 1.0 vs Base default 0.55
  - base `data/_hud_common.cfg:297 (view.qc:HUD_Damage line ~1304/1307)` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/ViewEffects.cs:62`
  - The final drawn alpha is multiplied by autocvar_hud_damage (the master flash strength). Base ships 0.55; the port's fallback is 1.0, making the flash nearly 2x more opaque on top of the already-too-strong factor. Compounds finding #1.
- **[minor]** Damage flash decays at the wrong rate: hud_damage_fade_rate fallback 0.5 vs Base 0.75
  - base `data/_hud_common.cfg:304 (view.qc:HUD_Damage line ~1252)` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/ViewEffects.cs:60`
  - myhealth_flash fades by autocvar_hud_damage_fade_rate * frametime each frame, and the same rate drives the dead-state ramp-up. Base ships 0.75/s; the port falls back to 0.5/s, so the flash lingers ~50% longer and the death fade ramps slower than Base when the cvar is unset.
- **[minor]** hud_damage_maxalpha fallback 1.0 vs Base default 1.5
  - base `data/_hud_common.cfg:305 (view.qc:HUD_Damage line ~1254)` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/ViewEffects.cs:59`
  - myhealth_flash is clamped to hud_damage_maxalpha. Base allows the accumulator to climb to 1.5 (so successive hits stack a deeper reserve that fades over more frames); the port caps it at 1.0, changing the saturation/persistence behavior on heavy damage.
- **[minor]** Near-death pulsating pain-threshold lowering not ported (HUD_Damage)
  - base `qcsrc/client/view.qc:HUD_Damage (lines 1256-1264)` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/ViewEffects.cs:136-183 (UpdateDamage)`
  - When myhealth < hud_damage_pain_threshold_lower_health (Base 50), view.qc lowers pain_threshold by a sin-pulsating amount (hud_damage_pain_threshold_lower 1.25, pulsating_min 0.6, period 0.8) — driving pain_threshold negative so a permanent throbbing red overlay appears at low health. The port's UpdateDamage has no eq…
- **[minor]** cl_eventchase_viewoffset "0 0 20" lift entirely omitted from death-cam
  - base `qcsrc/client/view.qc:View_EventChase (lines 811-828) + xonotic-client.cfg:219` → port `XonoticGodot/game/PlayerController.cs:419-471 (ApplyEventChase)`
  - Before pulling the camera back, view.qc raises the origin by cl_eventchase_viewoffset (default '0 0 20'): it traces up by view_offset (+ maxs.z) and lifts current_view_origin.z to that. The port's ApplyEventChase starts the pull-back from the RAW eye with no viewoffset lift at all, so the Base death-cam sits ~20 units…
- **[minor]** Eventchase trace box is ±8 on all axes; Base mins/maxs are ±12 horizontal, ±8 vertical
  - base `data/xonotic-client.cfg:217-218 (view.qc:View_EventChase line 856)` → port `XonoticGodot/game/PlayerController.cs:459`
  - view.qc box-traces the chase camera with cl_eventchase_mins/maxs = '-12 -12 -8' / '12 12 8'. The port hardcodes mins=(-8,-8,-8), maxs=(8,8,8), so the camera keeps only 8u of horizontal clearance from walls instead of 12u — the camera will get closer to / clip side geometry differently than Base. (Vertical ±8 matches; …
- **[minor]** cl_spawnzoom spawn-zoom-in effect (Base default ON) has no port equivalent
  - base `qcsrc/client/view.qc:GetCurrentFov (lines 512-520) + xonotic-client.cfg:56-58` → port `XonoticGodot/game/PlayerController.cs:324-363 (UpdateZoom)`
  - GetCurrentFov has a spawn-zoom branch: when cl_spawnzoom (Base default 1 = ON) and zoomin_effect, it eases current_viewzoom out from 1/spawnzoomfactor to 1 on spawn (a brief zoom-in-then-settle). The port's UpdateZoom models only the held-button zoom; there is no spawn zoom state, so the characteristic Xonotic spawn z…
- **[nit]** Eye contents sampled at fixed eye, not at the rendered view_origin (diverges during chase)
  - base `qcsrc/client/view.qc:HUD_Contents (line 1176)` → port `XonoticGodot/game/PlayerController.cs:312-316 (SampleEyeContents)`
  - view.qc does pointcontents(view_origin), where view_origin is the FINAL render origin — during event-chase that is the pulled-back camera position, so the liquid tint reflects where the camera actually is. The port always samples at Player.Origin + eye height (the first-person eye), so when the death/chase camera pull…
- **[nit]** Damage tint color (0.8,0,0) vs Base hud_damage_color "1 0 0"
  - base `data/_hud_common.cfg:302` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/ViewEffects.cs:73`
  - Base's hud_damage_color default is pure red "1 0 0"; the port hardcodes DamageColor = (0.8, 0, 0), a slightly darker red, and (unlike the contents path) never reads hud_damage_color from the cvar store, so even a loaded cfg can't correct it. Subtle color mismatch.

### T7-gametype-score-columns-sort-keys — minor-gaps — 5 confirmed (2 major)
- **[major]** AddToPlayer hard-wires `forced = true` whenever a hook is installed, so game_stopped never zeroes the delta
  - base `qcsrc/server/scores.qc:PlayerScore_Add` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Scoring/GameScores.cs:311-328`
  - QC: `mutator_returnvalue = MUTATOR_CALLHOOK(AddPlayerScore,...); if(!mutator_returnvalue && game_stopped) score = 0;` — the game_stopped clamp is bypassed ONLY when the hook actually returns true (a handler claimed the event). The port computes `forced = newDelta != delta || true;` which is unconditionally true, then …
- **[major]** Team-score layer collapsed to one flat int per team — no ST_SCORE+ST_<mode> two-slot model, no team primary/secondary or per-slot label/flags
  - base `qcsrc/common/scores.qh:149-158 / server/scores.qc:TeamScore_Compare,ScoreInfo_SetLabel_TeamScore` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Scoring/GameScores.cs:31-32,348-378,483-489`
  - QC teamscores are a 2-element array (MAX_TEAMSCORE=2): ST_SCORE plus a gametype slot (ST_CTF_CAPS / ST_DOM_TICKS / ST_DOM_CAPS / ST_KH_CAPS / ST_ONS_GENS / ST_NEXBALL_GOALS / ST_FT_ROUNDS / ST_CA_ROUNDS / ST_RACE_LAPS / ST_ASSAULT_OBJECTIVES), each with its own teamscores_label/teamscores_flags and a teamscores_primar…
- **[minor]** PlayerScore_Sort spectator exclusion (nospectators / FRAGS_SPECTATOR) not reproduced
  - base `qcsrc/server/scores.qc:PlayerScore_Sort:751-761` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Scoring/GameScores.cs:463-477 / XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Server/Scores.cs:537-543`
  - QC PlayerScore_Sort takes a `nospectators` flag and skips any client whose frags == FRAGS_SPECTATOR when building the sort chain. The port's SortPlayers/Sorted/Leader take whatever Entity/PlayerScoreRow collection they are handed and never filter spectators, so a spectator with a leftover score row can be ranked / ret…
- **[minor]** Domination always declares the DOM_TICKS column, even in the roundbased branch where QC declares only DOM_TAKES
  - base `qcsrc/common/gametypes/gametype/domination/sv_domination.qc:ScoreRules_dom:533-555` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/GameTypes/Domination.cs:127-134`
  - QC ScoreRules_dom has two arms. Roundbased: GameRules_scoring(teams, SFL_SORT_PRIO_PRIMARY, 0, { field_team(ST_DOM_CAPS,'caps',PRIMARY); field(SP_DOM_TAKES,'takes',0); }) — note NO SP_DOM_TICKS column and the team metric is ST_DOM_CAPS. Non-roundbased: declares ST_DOM_TICKS/SP_DOM_TICKS/SP_DOM_TAKES with the disable_f…
- **[nit]** RegisterAll default labels/flags for several gametype columns diverge from QC (dead but misleading; relied on only if a mode forgets to DeclareColumn)
  - base `qcsrc/common/gametypes/gametype/keepaway/sv_keepaway.qh:17-19 (and kh/ons/tka/surv per-mode field() calls)` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Common/Gameplay/Scoring/GameScores.cs:85-110`
  - GameScores.RegisterAll bakes label/flag defaults that do not match the per-mode QC field() registrations: KEEPAWAY_BCTIME is given label "bckills" + HideZero (QC: 'bctime', flags 0, no Time), KH_DESTRUCTIONS label "destroyed" (QC kh field uses 'destructions'), TKA_BCTIME given HideZero|Time (QC: 'bctime', SECONDARY on…

### T13-deluxemap-materials — minor-gaps — 3 confirmed (0 major)
- **[minor]** Deluxemap direction data decoded but never used for lighting (r_shadow.c normal-lighting unimplemented)
  - base `Base/darkplaces/r_shadow.c (deluxe normal lighting) + Base/darkplaces/gl_rsurf.c:137 (surface->deluxemaptexture used) + Base/darkplaces/model_brush.c:5807 (surface->deluxemaptexture assigned)` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Formats/Bsp/BspData.cs:96 (Deluxemaps stored), XonoticGodot/game/assets/LightmapShader.cs:49-57 (fragment never samples a deluxemap)`
  - The task's canonical source explicitly names r_shadow.c 'deluxe normal lighting' and gl_rsurf.c consumes surface->deluxemaptexture as the per-texel light direction for normal-mapped/bumped lighting. The port de-interleaves the deluxe pages into BspData.Deluxemaps but no code path ever reads them — a project-wide grep …
- **[minor]** External-lightmap (lm_NNNN) maps skip deluxemap de-interleaving entirely
  - base `Base/darkplaces/model_brush.c:5577-5611 (external lightmap load) + 5628-5677 (deluxe detect runs on the external set with bytesperpixel=4)` → port `XonoticGodot/src/XonoticGodot.Formats/Bsp/BspReader.cs:92 (split runs only on internal rawLightmapPages), XonoticGodot/game/MapLoader.cs:296-309 (external lm_NNNN loaded by raw face index)`
  - In DP, when a map has no internal lightmaps, the lm_%04d external set is loaded AND the same deluxemap detection/de-interleave runs over it (it uses count/size from the external images). The port only runs DetectAndSplitDeluxemaps over the internal lump (rawLightmapPages from lump 14); for an external-lightmap map tha…
- **[minor]** Static-only 'tcMod scale' is silently dropped (comment claims Uv1Scale handles it, but it is never set)
  - base `Base/darkplaces/model_shared.c:1800 (Q3TCMOD_SCALE) — scale multiplies the stage's texcoords` → port `XonoticGodot/game/assets/ShaderCompiler.cs:299-302 (NeedsAnimatedShader skips scale), :153-181 BuildSingleStandard / :218-249 BuildChainStage (no Uv1Scale set)`
  - A stage whose only tcMod is a static `scale sx sy` (no scroll/rotate/stretch/turb) is routed to the StandardMaterial3D path because NeedsAnimatedShader returns false for a lone Scale. The comment at ShaderCompiler.cs:300 says 'A static scale alone doesn't need a custom shader (Uv1Scale handles it)', but neither BuildS…

### T20-effectinfo-particles — major-gaps — 10 confirmed (2 major)
- **[major]** underwater / notunderwater block gating is parsed but never applied at spawn
  - base `Base/darkplaces/cl_particles.c:CL_NewParticlesFromEffectinfo:1625-1628` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/EffectSystem.cs:567-623 (BuildFromInfo block loop)`
  - DP computes `underwater` from CL_PointSuperContents(center) and skips any block flagged PARTICLEEFFECT_UNDERWATER when not underwater and PARTICLEEFFECT_NOTUNDERWATER when underwater. The port parses these into info.Underwater/NotUnderwater (EffectInfo.cs:245-246) but BuildFromInfo's block loop never references them, …
- **[major]** Fractional `count` over-spawns: persistent particleaccumulator replaced by ceil() floored at 1
  - base `Base/darkplaces/cl_particles.c:CL_NewParticlesFromEffectinfo:1710-1754` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/EffectSystem.cs:642-647 (BuildInfoBurst count)`
  - DP accumulates the fractional spawn count into a persistent per-info field (`info->particleaccumulator += cnt`, then `for (;particleaccumulator >= 1; particleaccumulator--)`), so a block with `count 0.5` averages ~0.5 particles per call and `count 0.025` averages ~1 per 40 calls. The port has no persistent accumulator…
- **[minor]** Missing `cnt == 0` guard: pure-dlight blocks emit a stray default particle
  - base `Base/darkplaces/cl_particles.c:CL_NewParticlesFromEffectinfo:1719-1720` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/EffectSystem.cs:647 (BuildInfoBurst)`
  - DP skips an emitter when the computed count is zero: `if (cnt == 0) continue;` so a block with no count/countabsolute/trailspacing (countmultiplier=0, countabsolute=0) produces only its dlight and no particles. The port floors n at 1 (`Math.Clamp((int)ceil(cnt),1,1024)`) with no cnt==0 short-circuit, so such blocks al…
- **[minor]** airfriction mapped to Godot Damping with a dimensionally-wrong heuristic
  - base `Base/darkplaces/cl_particles.c:CL_MoveParticles:2972-2976` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/EffectSystem.cs:725-728`
  - DP airfriction is a per-second FRACTION of velocity (exponential-ish decay): each frame `f = 1 - min(airfriction*frametime,1); vel *= f`. The port converts it to Godot ParticleProcessMaterial.Damping (which is an absolute units/sec linear velocity reduction) via `Damping = airfriction * baseSpeed * 0.5`. This only app…
- **[minor]** originoffset / relativeoriginoffset / relativevelocityoffset parsed but never applied to spawn
  - base `Base/darkplaces/cl_particles.c:CL_NewParticlesFromEffectinfo:1751-1773` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/EffectSystem.cs:675-689 (BuildInfoBurst position/velocity)`
  - DP adds originoffset directly and relativeoriginoffset/relativevelocityoffset rotated into the velocity-derived forward/right/up basis: spawn origin = trailpos + originoffset + originjitter*rvec (after VectorMAMAMAM with relativeoriginoffset), spawn velocity adds the rotated relativevelocityoffset. The port only consu…
- **[minor]** bounce / liquidfriction unmodeled: no particle collision, no bounce, no bounce<0 blood-splat
  - base `Base/darkplaces/cl_particles.c:CL_MoveParticles:2982-2999 (+ CL_NewParticle pbounce doc)` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/EffectSystem.cs:638-763 (BuildInfoBurst)`
  - DP particles collide against world geometry when bounce!=0 and cl_particles_collisions is on: they bounce, are removed on solid hit, and a `bounce -1` particle (blood) creates a splat/stain on impact. The port's GpuParticles3D have no collision at all and never read info.Bounce or info.LiquidFriction. Consequences: pa…
- **[minor]** Decal projected along emit-velocity axis instead of DP's nearest-surface search
  - base `Base/darkplaces/cl_particles.c:CL_SpawnDecalParticleForPoint:981-1008 (called from :1681)` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/EffectSystem.cs:589-599 + Decals.cs:45-74`
  - For a pt_decal block DP calls CL_SpawnDecalParticleForPoint, which fires 32 random rays (VectorRandom) out to maxdist (= originjitter[0]) and projects the decal onto the CLOSEST hit surface using that surface's normal (it does NOT orient the decal along the velocity). The port instead passes the emit velocity / impact…
- **[nit]** Per-type default table: blood orientation is Spark, should be Billboard
  - base `Base/darkplaces/cl_particles.c:particletype[]:39 (pt_blood)` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/EffectInfo.cs:315 (DefaultsFor)`
  - DP's particletype[] gives pt_blood {PBLEND_INVMOD, PARTICLE_BILLBOARD}. The port's DefaultsFor(Blood) returns (InvMod, Spark). Since the file sets `orientation` on only 2 of 9043 lines, all 24 `type blood` blocks rely on this default, so every blood particle is flagged Spark instead of Billboard. No functional consequ…
- **[nit]** Per-type default table: raindecal blend is InvMod, should be Add
  - base `Base/darkplaces/cl_particles.c:particletype[]:36 (pt_raindecal)` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/EffectInfo.cs:312 (DefaultsFor)`
  - DP's particletype[] gives pt_raindecal {PBLEND_ADD, PARTICLE_ORIENTED_DOUBLESIDED}. The port's DefaultsFor(RainDecal) returns (InvMod, Oriented) — blend wrong. No current consequence because the port skips Rain/Snow/RainDecal/EntityParticle kinds entirely (BuildFromInfo treats them as weather no-ops), but the table co…
- **[nit]** DensityScale multiplies countabsolute (DP excludes it from the quality multiplier)
  - base `Base/darkplaces/cl_particles.c:CL_NewParticlesFromEffectinfo:1710-1718` → port `XonoticGodot/game/client/EffectSystem.cs:643-646 (BuildInfoBurst)`
  - DP applies cl_particles_quality only to the count-multiplier term and the trailspacing term, never to countabsolute (the baseline comment: 'absolute number of particles ... unaffected by quality and requestedcount'). The port folds cl_particles_quality into DensityScale and multiplies the whole sum, including CountAbs…

## 📎 Base/ source map (canonical reference per task)

**Premise:** every task is a *port of existing Xonotic/Darkplaces code*, not a new feature. Before implementing a
task, read its Base source below and mirror it; cite it in the port file's `// Port of <path>` header (the convention
124 port files already follow). Paths are relative to repo root: `qcsrc/…` = `Base/data/xonotic-data.pk3dir/qcsrc/…`,
`data/…` = `Base/data/xonotic-data.pk3dir/…`, `Base/darkplaces/…` = the engine C. *(Generated 2026-06-06 by an

  - *notes:* FOV/zoom/eventchase/damage-tint/content-tint are all 100% CSQC logic in view.qc — no darkplaces C needed except the engine-side r_glsl_postprocess uservec cvars it drives (those are an engine contract, not a file to port).

  - → *port:* New XonoticGodot/game/hud/HudConfigEditor (configure-mode interactions) consuming HudPanel.cs/HudManager.cs; skin-list backend → extend XonoticGodot/game/menu/framework/HudPanelCommon.cs. Menu side DialogHudSetupExit.cs already exists.
  - *notes:* The 'HUD skin-list backend' = the hud_skin cvar + the gfx/hud/<skin>/ path resolution (hud_skin_path) and the .cfg export naming (hud_<skin>_<cfgname>.cfg) — all driven from HUD_Panel_ExportCfg in hud_config.qc and hud_skin_path setup in hud.qc HUD_Main. The editor reads/writes the SAME hud_panel_* cvars the live panels (T10/T29) consume via HUD_Panel_UpdatePosSize, so hud.qh is shared canon. Ski…

NEW: an I18n/gettext layer (l…
  - *notes:* Two distinct subsystems. SKIN/THEME: loader = menu.qc; schema+setter = skin.qh + skin-customizables.inc (the .inc is the value-bearing list — both the var declarations and the parse switch are generated from it, so it is the authoritative theme schema). The skinvalues.txt files themselves live under gfx/menu/<skin>/ (asset data, now in XonoticGodot.Assets). LOCALIZATION: _() is compile-time (GMQCC), …

  - *notes:* Two distinct deliverables. (1) CLOSE THE GOLDEN-TRACE LOOP: today movement_ref.c (tools/movement-ref/) is an INDEPENDENT analytic reference over a handful of hand-built convex brushes (flat/step/ramp/water) transcribed from the preprocessed QC (player.qc + ecs/systems/physics.qc + movetypes/). 'Capture from a running Darkplaces' means instead recording real engine traces — so the canonical refere…

(2) GameTypeVote = the GameTypeVote_* functions in server/mapvoting.qc (NOT vote.qc). (3) map-vote network ballot UI = the server sender in server/mapvoting.qc + the receiver/renderer in client/mapvoting.qc. The generic /vyes /vcall vote verbs themselves live in vote.qc. Note…

  - *notes:* Largely NOT a code-port task — it is build/CI/perf/packaging infrastructure with essentially NO canonical QuakeC source. (a) CI pipeline: pure infra, no Base source (upstream's own CI is GitLab-side, not in this checkout; Base/darkplaces/.travis.yml and Base/netradiant/.drone.yml exist but are for the C engine / radiant tooling, irrelevant to the C#/Godot port). (b) GC/alloc perf pass: a .NET pro…

- *(landed) bot-navigation perf pass* — `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Bot/Waypoint.cs`: (1) `TryParseVec` now strips the
  Quake `vtos` single-quote wrapper **before** splitting (vtos right-aligns small components → a leading space
  inside the quotes, e.g. `' 46.8 -380.6 536.0'`, which the old per-token trim mis-split) — the shipped
  `.waypoints`/`.cache`/`.hardwired` graphs previously parsed to **0 nodes**, silently forcing the ~219 ms O(N²)
  `AutoLink` tracewalk graph build on every map; (2) `ForMap` now loads the precompiled `.cache`/`.hardwired`
  link files (only `AutoLink`s when no cache ships) so the per-map graph build is ~8 ms, not ~219 ms; (3)
  `Nearest` collects→sorts→returns first reachable (caps the per-candidate `CanWalk` tracewalks to ~1: 1.17 →
  0.04 ms/call, ~29×); (4) A* `FindPath` reuses pooled buffers + heap. Net: full `BotBrain.Think` ~0.039
  ms/bot/tick on atelier (was ~0.075), allocs −35%. Verified by `tests/XonoticGodot.Tests/BotPerfBench.cs` (real
  atelier load) + a parse regression test in `BotNavTests`. **Still open:** the bot think is not yet called from
  the live server loop (`GameWorld`/`ServerNet` drive inert bots — `BotBrain.Think` has no caller outside tests),
  so `--host --bots N` doesn't yet exercise this; wiring havocbot_ai into `StartFrame` is a separate task.

- `qcsrc/client/main.qc` — **CSQC_Init, CSQC_InputEvent (shared input incl. View_InputEvent zoom scroll), CSQC_Parse_* (server messages that both live & demo consume), …** — CSQC entry/registration that wires CSQC_UpdateView + input + the demo-vs-live distinction; shows the demo path reuses the same view/HUD machinery (no parallel renderer). Reference for how a single sh…
  - → *port:* Reconcile XonoticGodot/game/net/NetGame.cs (SetupCameraAndHud / BuildViewState / ViewModel / NetHud) with XonoticGodot/game/GameDemo.cs into a shared first-person-view component; fold XonoticGodot/game/net/NetHud.cs and XonoticGodot/game/client/ViewEffects.cs + ViewModel.cs into that one component used by both.
  - *notes:* This is a port-architecture reconciliation (ADR-style), not a new Base feature. The canonical evidence is that Xonotic has NO split: NetGame and GameDemo in the port both re-implement what CSQC_UpdateView does once. So the 'source' to mirror is view.qc itself (plus main.qc for the live/demo wiring) — the lesson is that zoom/death-cam/chase/full-HUD/viewmodel/muzzleflash should be ONE component pa…

## 📎 Base/ source map — re-audit tasks T35–T61 (2026-06-07)

Same convention as above: `qcsrc/…` = `Base/data/xonotic-data.pk3dir/qcsrc/…`; cite the file in the port's
`// Port of <path>` header. Generated by the 18-subsystem re-audit (each ref read + adversarially verified).

### T35 — World-item spawn + touch pipeline
- `qcsrc/server/items/items.qc` — **StartItem (1007), Item_Touch (686), Item_GiveTo / Item_GiveAmmoTo (490-684, powerup *_finished timer block 598-643), Item_Show (130), Item_Respawn / Item_RespawnCountdown (236-313), the ITEM_IS_LOOT toss branch (1062-1098)** — the whole item-entity lifecycle; the port has only the give+respawn *tail* (`ItemPickupRules`).
- `qcsrc/server/items/spawning.qc` — **Item_Initialise (27), Item_IsDefinitionAllowed (17), the compat aliases item_armor1/armor25/health1/health25/health100/armor_large/health_large (99-105)**
- `qcsrc/common/items/item/{health,armor,ammo}.qh` — **SPAWNFUNC_ITEM(item_health_small/…/item_armor_mega/item_shells/…)** — the classname→def table
- `qcsrc/common/mutators/mutator/powerups/powerup/{strength,shield,invisibility,speed,fuelregen,jetpack}.qh` — **SPAWNFUNC_ITEM(item_strength/item_shield/item_invisible/item_invisibility/item_speed/item_fuel_regen/item_jetpack)** — powerup pickup items (effects already done in T11)
- `qcsrc/common/mutators/mutator/buffs/buffs.qh` — **spawnfunc(item_buff_##e) macro + buff/*.qc (13 buffs)** — buff pickup items (BuffsMutator already ports the effects/touch)
  - → *port:* `src/.../Gameplay/Items/*` (extend HealthItem/ArmorItem/AmmoItem + new powerup/buff item defs), `.../MapObjects/MapObjectsRegistry.cs` (register all item_*/weapon_* spawnfuncs), `src/XonoticGodot.Server/GameWorld.cs` (Item_Touch wire to `ItemPickupRules.GiveTo`)
  - *notes:* The single largest items gap — **nothing spawns pickups into the world**, so HealthItem/ArmorItem/AmmoItem + the whole `ItemPickupRules` engine are unreachable dead code (zero external callers). Also covers: weapon-stay (`g_weapon_stay` translucent item + ammo-from-stay path), the loot lifecycle (toss/`g_items_dropped_lifetime`/spawn-shield/NODROP-kill) so pinata/random/death-drop loot becomes collectable, and the full `GiveItems` operator grammar (`OP_MIN/MAX/PLUS/MINUS`, `all`/`allweapons`/`allammo`/`ALL` aggregates) shared with `target_items` + cheat give.

### T36 — Untracked-mode map-objective spawnfuncs
- `qcsrc/common/gametypes/gametype/assault/sv_assault.qc` — **spawnfunc(target_objective / target_objective_decrease / func_assault_destructible / func_assault_wall / target_assault_roundstart / target_assault_roundend / info_player_attacker / info_player_defender)**
- `qcsrc/common/gametypes/gametype/nexball/sv_nexball.qc` — **spawnfunc(nexball_redgoal / bluegoal / yellowgoal / pinkgoal / nexball_fault / nexball_out) + the ball spawn**
- `qcsrc/common/gametypes/gametype/invasion/sv_invasion.qc` — **spawnfunc(invasion_spawnpoint / invasion_wave / target_invasion_roundend)**
- `qcsrc/common/gametypes/gametype/cts/sv_cts.qc` + `qcsrc/server/race.qc` — **target_startTimer / target_stopTimer**
- `qcsrc/common/gametypes/gametype/keyhunt/sv_keyhunt.qc` — **item_kh_key** (KH spawns keys onto players at round start, so lower-impact)
  - → *port:* `src/.../Gameplay/MapObjects/MapObjectsRegistry.cs` (add `SpawnFuncs.Register` routing through `GametypeObjectiveSpawns.Sink`), `src/XonoticGodot.Server/GameWorld.cs` (`WireObjectiveSpawns` arms for Assault/Nexball/Invasion/Cts), `.../GameTypes/{Assault,Nexball,Invasion,Cts}.cs` (call their existing AddObjective/SpawnGoal/AddWave/SpawnStartTimer APIs)
  - *notes:* The gametype *logic* is fully ported + unit-tested via the direct API, but the **map-entity seam is absent on both sides** — the BSP entity lump silently drops these classnames, so an assault_/nexball_/invasion_/cts map has zero objectives → no win path. P0 for those modes.

### T37 — Vehicle runtime seam (board / input / impulse / return)
- `qcsrc/common/vehicles/sv_vehicles.qc` — **vehicles_touch (874), vehicles_enter (931), vehicle_use (522), vehicle_impulse (912), vehicles_setreturn/return/showwp (426-520), vehicle_initialize controller/targetname/ACTIVE_NOT/g_vehicles_delayspawn (1168-1287); MUTATOR_CALLHOOK(VehicleInit/Enter/Exit/Touch) at 1283/1072/848/876**
- `qcsrc/common/vehicles/vehicle/{racer,raptor,spiderbot,bumblebee}.qc` — **\*_frame (read PHYS_INPUT_BUTTON_*/movement/v_angle), \*_impulse (raptor/spiderbot W2MODE), bumblebee_touch/gunner_enter/gunner_exit**
  - → *port:* `src/.../Gameplay/Vehicles/*` (wire the existing Enter/CycleMode/SetMode/VehInput), `src/XonoticGodot.Engine/Simulation/*` (touch dispatch + seated-player frame), `game/net/{NetGame,ServerNet}.cs` (impulse routing + HUD stat), `.../Mutators/MutatorHooks.cs` (4 new hooks)
  - *notes:* `EnterVehicle`/`GunnerEnter`/per-vehicle `Frame`/`SetMode` all exist but are **orphaned** — no boarding path, `VehInput` never written (zero `VehInput =` writes), impulses never routed. The entire vehicle subsystem is dead code between "spawned" (T14) and "playable". P0 for vehicle maps.

### T38 — Minigame activation (lifecycle + cmd + client + menu)
- `qcsrc/common/minigames/sv_minigames.qc` — **start_minigame / join_minigame / part_minigame / end_minigame / invite_minigame / minigame_addplayer / ClientCommand_minigame; minigame_SendEntity + MSLE delta network**
- `qcsrc/common/minigames/cl_minigames.qc` + `cl_minigames_hud.qc` — **network_receive dispatch, active_minigame; HUD_MinigameMenu_Open/Close/ClickCreate/Join/Invite/CurrentGame/Quit/CustomEntry, HUD_MinigameHelp, HUD_Minigame_InputEvent/Mouse**
- `qcsrc/common/minigames/minigames.qc` + `minigame/{ttt,c4,nmm,pong,pp,ps,bd}.qc` — **minigame_SendEntity/CheckSend; each game's server_event/client_event(menu_show/menu_click/key_pressed), \*_hud_status; bd.qc bd_load_level/bd_save_level**
  - → *port:* `src/.../Gameplay/Minigames/*` (already has the rule engines + AIs), `game/hud/{MinigameRenderer,HudManager}.cs` (call `Show`/`OnMove`; add keyboard/two-tile/capture input + per-game status), `game/net/MinigameNetState.cs` (wire encode/decode), `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Commands.cs` (`minigame` verb + session mgr), new minigame HUD menu
  - *notes:* Entire subsystem **absent from the old TODO**; 8 games + framework ported but every entry point is unwired. `cmd minigame` is the ONLY way to start/join in Xonotic. Bulldozer also needs on-disk levels (ships none → no puzzles). A spawned background task (`task_b2187e72`) was also raised for this during the audit.

### T39 — Wire HavocBot AI into the live loop
- `qcsrc/server/bot/default/bot.qc` — **bot_serverframe / bot_think (called from server/main.qc StartFrame), bot_strategytoken rotation, bot_fixcount**
- `qcsrc/server/bot/default/havocbot/havocbot.qc` — **havocbot_ai, havocbot_movetogoal (jetpack/rocketjump nav), havocbot_checkdanger (lava/slime/trigger_hurt/sky), havocbot_dodge**
- `qcsrc/server/bot/default/navigation.qc` — **navigation_unstuck, botframe_updatedangerousobjects**
  - → *port:* `src/XonoticGodot.Server/GameWorld.cs` (construct `BotController`, call `Frame()` in `OnStartFrame`), `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Bot/*` (the AI body exists; add danger/unstuck), `game/net/{NetGame,ServerNet}.cs` (bot input → movement/fire pipeline; today bots get `ZeroInput`)
  - *notes:* `BotController`/`BotBrain.Think` are a complete, unit-tested `havocbot_ai` port but `new BotController` has **zero hits** repo-wide. This one wiring change makes the whole AI come alive. (T25 = scripted `bot_cmd` VM, separate.)

### T40 — Server combat-event emission
- `qcsrc/server/damage.qc` — **Obituary() (Obituary_WeaponDeath/SpecialDeath → wr_killmessage/wr_suicidemessage variant select + Send_Notification(MSG_INFO kill-feed, MSG_CENTER frag/typefrag)), the killcount/spree increment + ANNCE_KILLSTREAK_* / MULTIFRAG**
- `qcsrc/server/player.qc` — **PlayerSound(playersound_pain100/75/50/25/death/gasp/drown) (368-469), SND_ARMORIMPACT/BODYIMPACT1/2 (327-335)**
- `qcsrc/common/weapons/weapon/*.qc` — **wr_killmessage/wr_suicidemessage per weapon (e.g. devastator.qc:558 SPLASH vs DIRECT; electro BOLT/COMBO/ORBS; vortex.qc:320)**
- `qcsrc/common/notifications/all.inc` + `globalsound.qh` — **INFO_DEATH_*/CENTER_DEATH_*/ANNCE_KILLSTREAK_*/MULTIFRAG/COUNTDOWN_*, REGISTER_PLAYERSOUND, REGISTER_GLOBALSOUND(STEP/FALL/GIB)**
  - → *port:* `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Scores.cs` (Obituary → NotificationSystem), `src/.../Gameplay/Damage/DamageSystem.cs` (sounds at hit/death), `.../Sounds/SoundSystem.cs`, `src/XonoticGodot.Server/WarmupController.cs` + per-round controllers (countdown announce)
  - *notes:* The registry (`NotificationsList`, `SoundsList`) + the wire + the HUD/announcer consumers are all **built and wired** — only the gameplay *emission* is missing (`MatchController.OnFrag` is an empty hook; `Scores.Obituary` mutates score columns only). The single biggest "feel" cluster.

### T41 — Client feedback drivers
- `qcsrc/client/view.qc` — **HitSound() (894-980: STAT(HITSOUND_DAMAGE_DEALT_TOTAL)/TYPEHIT/KILL, cl_hitsound 0/1/2/3 + min/max/nom_pitch + antispam), HUD_Draw DrawCircleClippedPic rings (NADE_TIMER/CAPTURE_PROGRESS/REVIVE_PROGRESS, ~1006)**
- `qcsrc/client/announcer.qc` — **Announcer_Gamestart/Announcer_Time/Announcer_Countdown (3-2-1 + ANNCE_PREPARE + ANNCE_REMAINING_MIN_1/5 from GAMESTARTTIME/ROUNDSTARTTIME/TIMELIMIT), Announcer_Duel**
- `qcsrc/common/physics/player.qc` — **PM_Footsteps (689-708, GS_STEP/STEP_METAL cadence), PM_check_hitground (664-687, GS_FALL/FALL_METAL on landing)**
  - → *port:* `game/client/*`, `game/hud/{HudNotifications,CrosshairPanel}.cs`, `game/net/NetGame.cs` (network the damage-dealt-total stat), `src/.../Physics/PlayerPhysics.cs` (footstep/landing cadence)
  - *notes:* These are CLIENT-clock-driven (the server doesn't send them). T34 wired announce *routing*; the *driver* + hitsound + footsteps are still absent.

### T42 — Global overtime / sudden-death win layer
- `qcsrc/server/world.qc` — **CheckRules_World (1725-1861), InitiateSuddenDeath (1467), InitiateOvertime (1499), WinningCondition_Scores (1560: leadlimit + WinningConditionHelper_equality + fragsleft ANNCE_REMAINING_FRAG_*), GetWinningCode (1510); WINNING_STARTSUDDENDEATHOVERTIME**
  - → *port:* `src/XonoticGodot.Server/GameWorld.cs` (`CheckRulesAndIntermission` → add the timelimit/overtime/sudden-death branch), `.../Gameplay/GameTypes/*.cs` (report tie/equality)
  - *notes:* Today each score-mode latches `MatchEnded` on its frag/point limit only and the timelimit path just ends the match → tied timed matches **draw** instead of going to overtime/sudden-death. Changes the outcome of essentially every close timed match.

### T43 — Monster damage→pain/death seam + reset
- `qcsrc/common/monsters/sv_monsters.qc` — **Monster_Damage (1083, installed as this.event_damage in Monster_Spawn 1457), Monster_Dead (1036) / Monster_Dead_Damage (1018) / Monster_Dead_Think→mr_deadthink (965), monster_dropitem (40), Monster_Heal (1148), Monster_Reset (999, this.reset), monsters_setstatus→STAT(MONSTERS_TOTAL/KILLED) (34)**
  - → *port:* `src/.../Gameplay/Monsters/MonsterAI.cs` (install a monster damage handler that calls existing `MarkPain`/`MarkDead`/`DropItem`/`Respawn`; add `Reset`, `DeadThink`, global counters), `.../Damage/DamageSystem.cs` (EventDamage routes a monster to the shim, not PlayerDamage), `game/hud/ScoreboardPanel.cs`
  - *notes:* `MarkPain`/`MarkDead`/`DropItem`/`Respawn` are fully written but have **zero callers** — a monster victim is dispatched to `PlayerDamage` and treated like a player. The brain (`RunThink`) does run, so this is purely the damage→death seam.

### T44 — Physics override hooks + spectator free-flight
- `qcsrc/ecs/systems/physics.qc` — **MUTATOR_CALLHOOK(PM_Physics, this, maxspeed_mod, dt) (108, override branch), MUTATOR_CALLHOOK(IsFlying, this) (113), the !IS_PLAYER spectator branch (58-63: sys_phys_spectator_control + maxspeed_mod = STAT(SPECTATORSPEED))**
- `qcsrc/ecs/systems/sv_physics.qc` — **sys_phys_spectator_control (67-103, impulse 1-19/200-229 speed steps), autocvar_sv_spectator_speed_multiplier* (3-5)**
- `qcsrc/common/mutators/events.qh` — **MUTATOR_HOOKABLE(PM_Physics) (98), MUTATOR_HOOKABLE(IsFlying) (61)**
  - → *port:* `src/.../Physics/PlayerPhysics.cs` (add the two hook call-sites + a `!IsPlayer` fly branch), `.../Gameplay/Mutators/MutatorHooks.cs` (add `PM_Physics`/`IsFlying` chains), `game/net/ServerNet.cs` (stop `DriveObserverJoins` zeroing observer velocity)
  - *notes:* `PM_Physics` is a **distinct** hook from `PlayerPhysics` (which T3 wired) — T3's recon conflated them, so T3's "PM_Physics wired" claim is wrong. Observers are currently frozen at world origin (no fly path). Unblocks bugrigs (T51).

### T45 — Warpzone combat traversal + portal rendering
- `qcsrc/lib/warpzone/common.qc` — **WarpZone_TraceBox_ThroughZone (192) / TraceBox (323) / TraceLine (328) / TraceToss_ThroughZone (333) / TrailParticles (451); WarpZone_FindRadius (660) + _Recurse (592) + WarpZoneLib_BadEntity (562); WarpZone_RefSys_* (670-787) + Accumulator (11-37)**
- `qcsrc/lib/warpzone/client.qc` — **WarpZone_FixView (216), FixNearClip (174), FixPMove (203), View_Inside/Outside (152/160), NET_HANDLE(ENT_CLIENT_WARPZONE[_CAMERA/_TELEPORTED]) PreDraw + view/input rotate (133)**
- `qcsrc/lib/warpzone/server.qc` — **WarpZone_Projectile_Touch (344), WarpZone_StoreProjectileData (36)**
  - → *port:* `src/XonoticGodot.Engine/Collision/*` (TraceService extension iterating the per-crossing transform, cap 16 zones), `.../MapObjects/Warpzone.cs` (already has WarpzoneTransform/Manager/Teleport), `.../Weapons/WeaponFiring.cs` + `.../Damage/DamageSystem.cs` (route traces/RadiusDamage through it — both already flag the gap in comments), `game/net/NetGame.cs` (SubViewport portal render)
  - *notes:* Transform/teleport half is ported (you can walk through); the trace-recursion + FindRadius + client render are absent, so combat **through** portals is broken (rockets explode on the surface, beams stop, splash doesn't cross) and the portal renders opaque. Distinct from the transform math (already done).

### T46 — Server chat engine
- `qcsrc/server/chat.qc` — **Say() (teamsay/privatesay branches, g_chat_allowed/_team_allowed/_private_allowed/_spectator_allowed gates, trigger_magicear_processmessage_forallears, formatmessage, Team_ColorCode)**
- `qcsrc/server/command/cmd.qc` — **ClientCommand_say_team / tell / ignore / unignore / clear_ignores (+ ignore_add_player/ignore_playerinlist crypto-idfp db, per-say flood control)**
  - → *port:* new `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Chat.cs` + `Commands.cs` (register the verbs), `game/net/ServerNet.cs` (route client say lines)
  - *notes:* Port has only a raw `say` (broadcast-to-all, `teamOnly` hardcoded false). `say_team` is match-critical for team modes; the messagemode/messagemode2 client binds already exist but have no server handler.

### T47 — Harden the client command bus (security)
- `qcsrc/server/command/cmd.qc` — **SV_ParseClientCommand (UTF-8 round-trip reject, Ban_MaybeEnforceBanOnce, floodcheck via sv_clientcommand_antispam_count/_time, MUTATOR_CALLHOOK(SV_ParseClientCommand))**
- `qcsrc/server/command/reg.qh` — **separate REGISTRY(SERVER_COMMANDS) vs REGISTRY(CLIENT_COMMANDS)** — only CLIENT_COMMANDS is reachable from a client
  - → *port:* `game/net/ServerNet.cs` (`HandleClientCommand` gate), `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Commands.cs` (mark commands server-only vs client-callable)
  - *notes:* **Security exposure** — today a remote client can invoke admin verbs (`ban`/`kick`/`gotomap`/`endmatch`/`settemp`) because there is one flat table and no source gate, plus no flood/UTF-8/ban checks.

### T48 — Map-entity content tail (hazard / props / ambient / music)
- `qcsrc/common/mapobjects/misc/laser.qc` — **spawnfunc(misc_laser), misc_laser_think (traceline + Damage(dmg*frametime, DEATH_HURTTRIGGER) / dmg<0 instakill), DETECTOR (enemy.target → SUB_UseTargets), team/LASER_INVERT_TEAM, Draw_Laser** (a real hazard)
- `qcsrc/common/mapobjects/models.qc` — **spawnfunc(misc_gamemodel/misc_models/misc_clientmodel/func_static/func_wall/func_illusionary/func_clientwall/func_clientillusionary), g_model_init/g_clientmodel_init (external .model, scale, colormap, drop-by-spawnflags, fade_start/end, LOD, bgmscript), Ent_Wall_Draw** (decoration props — most stock maps have several)
- `qcsrc/common/mapobjects/func/pointparticles.qc` — **spawnfunc(func_pointparticles / func_sparks), Draw_PointParticles**
- `qcsrc/common/mapobjects/func/rainsnow.qc` — **spawnfunc(func_rain / func_snow), Draw_RainSnow → te_particlerain/snow**
- `qcsrc/common/mapobjects/target/speaker.qc` — **spawnfunc(target_speaker), looped/triggered/global ambient sound** (looping-sound infra already exists)
- `qcsrc/common/mapobjects/target/music.qc` — **spawnfunc(target_music / trigger_music), TargetMusic_Advance / Ent_TriggerMusic_Think (default<target<trigger priority mix)** (in-game map music, distinct from menu music T23)
  - → *port:* `src/.../Gameplay/MapObjects/*` (register + implement), `game/client/*` (particle/beam/weather render via existing EffectSystem), `game/assets/models/*` (decoration model attach via Md3/Iqm builder)
  - *notes:* All silently no-op today (bare edicts kept). `func_static`/`func_wall`/`func_illusionary` render+collide statically via BuildMap+RegisterSubmodels — only the dynamic toggle/fade/LOD behavior is missing for those.

### T49 — Single-player campaign wiring
- `qcsrc/menu/xonotic/campaign.qc` — **XonoticCampaignList_loadCvars/campaignGo/drawListBoxItem/setSelected, CampaignList_LoadMap→CampaignSetup**
- `qcsrc/menu/xonotic/dialog_singleplayer.qc` — **XonoticSingleplayerDialog (campaign list + Instant Action)**
- `qcsrc/common/campaign_file.qc` — **CampaignFile_Load (maps/campaign<name>.txt)**
  - → *port:* `game/menu/SingleplayerScreen.cs` (replace the static 6-level array; read campaign file + `g_campaign<name>_index` progress; render unlock/checkmark/preview), `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Campaign.cs` (the faithful server core — **currently has zero callers**), `GameWorld.cs`
  - *notes:* Campaign is non-functional end-to-end AND the already-ported `Campaign.cs` (CampaignFile_Load/PreInit/PreIntermission/SaveCvar/Setup) is dead code.

### T50 — Menu command dispatch + game menu + visual pickers
- `qcsrc/menu/command/menu_cmd.qc` — **GameCommand: directmenu / closemenu / directpanelhudmenu / nexposee / servers / profile / skinselect / languageselect / settings / inputsettings / videosettings / dumptree / sync**
- `qcsrc/menu/xonotic/dialog_gamemenu.qc` + `leavematchbutton.qc` — **Join!/Spectate toggle (send join/spec), Leave-match, Quick menu, Servers/Profile/Guide jumps**
- `qcsrc/menu/xonotic/{crosshairpicker,crosshairpreview,playermodel,charmap,colorpicker,colorpicker_string,weaponslist}.qc` — **the visual picker widgets + reorderable cl_weaponpriority list**
- `qcsrc/menu/xonotic/{datasource,listbox}.qc` — **StringSource/CvarStringSource getEntry/reload contract** (shared list backend)
  - → *port:* `game/menu/framework/*` (by-name dialog registry + MenuCommand dispatch + reusable picker/listbox widgets), `game/menu/{PauseMenu,SingleplayerScreen}.cs`, `game/menu/dialogs/*`
  - *notes:* `MenuCommand.Dispatch` falls to an inert default for every nav verb; `PauseMenu` lacks Join/Spectate (the only menu path to switch playing↔spectating); pickers are downgraded to text/number controls.

### T51 — Remaining mutators (wave 2) + Overkill weapons + doublejump fix
- `qcsrc/common/mutators/mutator/hook/sv_hook.qc` — **REGISTER_MUTATOR(hook, g_grappling_hook); PlayerSpawn sets offhand = OFFHAND_HOOK; SetStartItems fuel** (offhand grapple in any mode — a dead menu toggle today; P1)
- `qcsrc/common/mutators/mutator/damagetext/{sv,cl,ui}_damagetext.qc` — **floating damage numbers (DTFLAG_* wire, ~30 cl_damagetext_* cvars, 2D/world)** (P1)
- `qcsrc/common/mutators/mutator/itemstime/itemstime.qc` — **it_times[], IT_Write net feed, Item_ItemsTime_SetTime/Allow** (server backend for the T10 panel)
- `qcsrc/common/mutators/mutator/bugrigs/bugrigs.qc` — **RaceCarPhysics via PM_Physics override** (needs T44)
- `…/{breakablehook,campcheck,kick_teamkiller,dynamic_handicap,superspec,sandbox,doublejump}/sv_*.qc` — **the remaining registered mutators; doublejump.qc needs the surface tracebox + velocity-clip (port currently treats sv_doublejump as unconditional)**
- `qcsrc/common/mutators/mutator/overkill/{okmachinegun,oknex,okshotgun,okhmg,okrpc}.qc` — **REGISTER_WEAPON(OVERKILL_*) full wr_think/checkammo/reload/aim**
  - → *port:* new `src/.../Gameplay/Mutators/*`, `.../Weapons/*` (5 Overkill weapon classes), `game/client/*` (damagetext draw)
  - *notes:* `OverkillMutator` references the 5 OK weapons by name but they resolve to **null** (g_overkill grants nothing). `hook`+`damagetext` are the user-facing P1s; `sandbox`/`superspec`/`kick_teamkiller`/`campcheck`/`dynamic_handicap` are admin/niche P3.

### T52 — Compat entity remaps (Q3 / QL / CPMA / Q1 / WoP / Q3DF)
- `qcsrc/server/compat/quake3.qc` — **SPAWNFUNC_Q3(weapon_railgun→Vortex / rocketlauncher→Devastator / lightning→Electro / …) + SPAWNFUNC_ITEM(item_quad→Strength / item_armor_body→ArmorMega / …) + ammo .count scaling + SG↔MG arena swap; the Q3DF target_init/target_score/target_fragsFilter/target_print (119-295)**
- `qcsrc/server/compat/{quake2,quake,wop}.qc` — **item_armor_jacket/invulnerability; weapon_supernailgun→Hagar/supershotgun→MachineGun; WoP weapon_punchy→Arc + item_padpower/holdable_floater→Jetpack**
  - → *port:* `src/.../Gameplay/MapObjects/MapObjectsRegistry.cs` + new `.../MapObjects/CompatRemaps.cs`. Depends on T35 (item/weapon spawn pipeline).
  - *notes:* Only the entity-*removal* filter (`DoesQ3ARemoveThisEntity`) is ported; the *add* side is absent → Q3/DeFRaG maps load geometry but have no pickups/weapons. `halflife.qc` needs no work (intentional no-ops).

### T53 — Round/objective HUD stats for untracked modes
- `qcsrc/common/gametypes/gametype/clanarena/sv_clanarena.qc` — **CA_count_alive_players → STAT(REDALIVE/BLUEALIVE/YELLOWALIVE/PINKALIVE)**
- `qcsrc/common/gametypes/gametype/freezetag/sv_freezetag.qc` — **freezetag_count_alive_players, eliminatedPlayers.SendFlags**
- `qcsrc/common/gametypes/gametype/keyhunt/sv_keyhunt.qc` — **kh_update_state → STAT(OBJECTIVE_STATUS)**
- `qcsrc/common/gametypes/gametype/survival/sv_survival.qc` — **SurvivalStatuses_SendEntity**
  - → *port:* `.../GameTypes/{ClanArena,FreezeTag,KeyHunt,Survival}.cs` (network the stats — currently comments only), `game/hud/ModIconsPanel.cs`
  - *notes:* MODICONS (T10) feeds only the tracked modes; CA/FT/KH/Survival spectator HUD + alive/key/role display have no data source.

### T54 — Movement / prediction breadth
- `qcsrc/common/stats.qh` — **REGISTER_STAT(MOVEVARS_*) (~44 movement stats)** — port replicates only 8
- `qcsrc/common/physics/player.qc` — **Physics_UpdateStats (44-151), Physics_ClientOption (18-42, g_physics_<set>_<opt> resolution), REPLICATE cvar_cl_physics (7)**
- `qcsrc/server/command/cmd.qc` — **ClientCommand_sentcvar (GetCvars)** + `client/command/cl_cmd.qc` LocalCommand_sendcvar (cl_weaponpriority/autoswitch/noantilag)
  - → *port:* `src/XonoticGodot.Net/{InputCommand,MoveVarsBlock}.cs`, `src/.../Physics/MovementParameters.cs`, `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Commands.cs`
  - *notes:* Fine on a listen server (client==server cvars) but a remote client or any non-default-physics server mispredicts/rubber-bands. `sentcvar` is also what feeds the (ported) priority weapon-cycling its custom order.

### T55 — Server-core fidelity gaps
- `qcsrc/server/teamplay.qc` — **Player_GetForcedTeamIndex (349) + g_forced_team_red/blue/yellow/pink/otherwise (41-44); sv_teamnagger warmup nag (1036)**
- `qcsrc/server/portals.qc` — **Portal_Spawn/Touch/TeleportPlayer/SetIn/OutPortal/Think/ClearAllLater (the Porto in/out portal pair)**
- `qcsrc/server/main.qc` — **CreatureFrame_FallDamage (142: have_hook immunity + Q3SURFACEFLAG_NODAMAGE floor check), CreatureFrame_hotliquids (70: lava_burn Fire_AddDamage + FL_PROJECTILE contents damage)**
  - → *port:* `src/XonoticGodot.Server/{Teamplay,PlayerFrameLogic}.cs`, `.../Weapons/Porto.cs` (wire `PortalSpawner` → `Warpzone.SpawnPortalAsWarpzone`), `.../MapObjects/Warpzone.cs`
  - *notes:* `Porto.PortalSpawner`/`SpawnPortalAsWarpzone` exist but nothing connects them, so firing the Porto creates no usable portal; forced teams + nagger are explicitly deferred in `Teamplay.cs`.

### T56 — Generic + client + reply command parity
- `qcsrc/common/command/generic.qc` + `rpn.qc` — **GENERIC_COMMAND(rpn / maplist / addtolist / removefromlist / qc_curl / dumpcommands / restartnotifs / nextframe / runtest); the RPN VM**
- `qcsrc/server/command/cmd.qc` — **ClientCommand_voice / suggestmap / autoswitch / physics / clientversion**
- `qcsrc/server/command/{common,getreplies}.qc` — **CommonCommand_records/rankings/lsmaps/printmaplist/ladder/cvar_purechanges/editmob; getreplies precompute**
- engine `defer` — used by `vote.qc` (restart vote) — needs a sim-clock command queue
  - → *port:* `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Commands.cs`, `src/XonoticGodot.Engine/Console/ConsoleCommands.cs`
  - *notes:* `rpn` underpins stock alias/quickmenu cfg logic; `defer` absence makes a passed `restart` vote silently no-op; `editmob`/`spawnmob`/`killmob` make the already-ported Monster-Tools dialog functional.

### T57 — Weapon tail
- `qcsrc/server/weapons/throwing.qc` — **W_ThrowWeapon / W_ThrowNewWeapon / W_IsWeaponThrowable / SpawnThrownWeapon (impulse 17; superweapon-timer split; pinata/death loot)**
- `qcsrc/server/weapons/accuracy.qc` — **accuracy_add(fired/hit/real) + accuracy_isgooddamage; called from tracing.qc:65 / damage.qc:929 / player.qc:442; accuracy_send (ENT_CLIENT_ACCURACY)**
- `qcsrc/common/weapons/weapon/vortex.qc` — **chargepool (190-265), vortex_charge GetPressedKeys velocity-charge (87-111), forced-reload (198)** (representative per-weapon secondary depth)
  - → *port:* `src/.../Gameplay/Weapons/*`, `.../Damage/DamageSystem.cs`, `src/XonoticGodot.Server/Scores.cs`
  - *notes:* `WeaponImpulses` swallows impulse 17 (no-op); `WeaponAccuracy.RecordShotFired/RecordHit` exist but are called **only** on kill-credit, so the scoreboard accuracy% + XonStat acc-* read 0.

### T58 — csqcmodel client render hooks
- `qcsrc/client/csqcmodel_hooks.qc` — **CSQCPlayer_ModelAppearance_Apply (cl_forceplayermodels/forcemyplayermodel/forceplayercolors/forceuniqueplayercolors + cl_deathglow + RESPAWNGHOST), CSQCModel_LOD_Apply (_lod1/_lod2), CSQCPlayer_FallbackFrame_Apply (anim remap table), CSQCModel_Effects_Apply (EF_FLAME/SHOCK/STARDUST/BRIGHTLIGHT + MF_ROCKET/GRENADE/GIB→traileffect + jetpack loop)**
  - → *port:* `game/client/{ModelAnimator,ModelTint,ClientWorld}.cs`
  - *notes:* The base anim + per-entity colormod/glowmod/team tint are done; force-model/colors are menu checkboxes that do nothing, and LOD/deathglow/fallback-frame/EF_*/MF_* derivation are absent.

### T59 — Map-object long tail
- `qcsrc/common/mapobjects/func/stardust.qc` (func_stardust = placed model + EF_STARDUST), `misc/dynlight.qc` (scripted/moving/attached light), `trigger/viewloc.qc` (trigger_viewlocation + target_viewlocation_start/end, 2.5D camera), `misc/follow.qc` (misc_follow attach helper), `func/fourier.qc` + `func/vectormamamam.qc` (advanced movers), `target/voicescript.qc` (scripted voice sequence)
  - → *port:* `src/.../Gameplay/MapObjects/*` (most reuse the T48 decoration-model + MovingBrushes paths)
  - *notes:* Rare/cosmetic; bare no-op edicts today (no crash). `viewloc` only meaningful once a fixed/side-view camera mode exists (T4 territory).

### T60 — Admin / server-ops breadth
- `qcsrc/server/cheats.qc` — **CheatImpulse (137-287: CHIMPULSE_CLONE_MOVING/STANDING, GIVE_ALL #99, TELEPORT, R00T nuke, SPEEDRUN); the Drag entity-carry subsystem (705-1043)**
- `qcsrc/server/ipban.qc` — **OnlineBanList_SendBan/SendUnban/Query + URI_Get_Callback (g_ban_sync_uri)**
- `qcsrc/server/weapons/{weaponstats,hitplot}.qc` — **sv_weaponstats matrix upload; sv_hitplot/g_hitplots per-shot hit-coord log**
- `qcsrc/server/command/vote.qc` — **VoteCommand_checkargs (sv_vote_command_restriction_*), VoteCommand_macro_help (sv_vote_command_help_*)**
  - → *port:* `src/XonoticGodot.Server/{Cheats,Bans,Commands,VoteController}.cs`
  - *notes:* Text cheats (god/noclip/give) already work; the numeric cheat impulses are unreachable (`DispatchImpulse` routes only to `WeaponImpulses`). Online ban federation needs an HTTP client.

### T61 — Feedback / notification polish
- `qcsrc/common/notifications/all.qh` — **Local_Notification_Queue_Process (NOTIF_QUEUE_MAX=10, queuetime, prev_soundfile/prev_soundtime dedup); ReplicateVars notification_CHOICE_* per-client cvars (MSG_CHOICE)**
- `qcsrc/common/deathtypes/all.{qh,inc}` — **REGISTRY(Deathtypes) + .message category (monster/turret/vehicle) + DEATH_ISMONSTER/ISTURRET/ISVEHICLE + Deathtype_Name**
- `qcsrc/common/mutators/mutator/status_effects/*` — **StatusEffects_update (NET sync of statuseffect_time[]/flags[]), STATUSEFFECT_FLAG_PERSISTENT** (client burning/frozen overlays)
- `qcsrc/common/effects/qc/globalsound.qc` — **_GlobalSound VOICETYPE_TEAMRADIO/TAUNT/AUTOTAUNT/LASTATTACKER routing + directional attenuation; the voice/taunt commands**
  - → *port:* `game/hud/HudNotifications.cs`, `src/.../Gameplay/{Damage/DeathTypes,Notifications,Sounds}/*`
  - *notes:* Announcer voices currently stomp (no queue/dedup); voice-message/taunt subsystem is registry-only (`PlayVoiceMessage` ignores all VOICETYPE routing and has zero call sites). Mostly gated behind T40 obituary emission existing.
