/// <c>Image.CreateFromData</c> COPIES the buffer synchronously into the Godot Image (so it's free to reuse on

/// guaranteed to be ≥ the requested size, so its oversized tail would be read as extra pixels. Buffers are
/// therefore keyed by exact byte length, and a reused buffer is cleared so it is byte-identical to a fresh

/// threads on a many-core box and each grew its own per-size buffer set — "pooled" decodes still allocated
