/// <see cref="ViewModel"/>) and exposes a tiny, dependency-free public API that the networking layer
/// (<c>game/net/ClientNet</c>, owned by another agent) calls as packets arrive:
///
///   • <see cref="OnEffect"/>      — a networked particle effect fired (Send_Effect / EFF_NET_* decode).
///   • <see cref="OnEntityUpdate"/>— an entity entered/changed in the client's snapshot (CSQC ent update).
///   • <see cref="OnEntityRemove"/>— an entity left the snapshot / was freed.
///   • <see cref="OnSound"/>       — a positional sound event (QC sound() on an entity/point).
///   • <see cref="OnMuzzleFlash"/> — the local player fired (drives the view-model flash).
///
