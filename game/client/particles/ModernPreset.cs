// =====================================================================================================
//  ModernPreset — the per-effect DRAW knobs of the modern GPU backend (planning/particles-dual-system.md
//  §B.3 / §D.1). The faithful SPAWN+INTEGRATE math is identical for every modern emitter (it's DP's actual
//  algorithm, in ModernParticleShaders' process shader); a preset only flips the modern *rendering* features
//  on/off per effect so gameplay readability is preserved one effect at a time — soft-particle depth fade,
//  lit/shadowed smoke, curl-noise turbulence, ribbon/tube trail meshes, flipbook atlases, HDR emissive boost.
//
//  Presets are pure value records (no Godot deps): ModernPresetLibrary returns them by id, the authoring
//  overlay (effectinfo_xg.txt, §D.1) can override individual knobs, and ModernParticleBackend reads them when
//  building each emitter's draw-pass material. The SHAPE of the enabled knobs also keys the compiled-shader
//  cache in ModernParticleShaders, so two effects sharing a preset share one GPU pipeline.
