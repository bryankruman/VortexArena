//  ModernPresetLibrary — the named ModernPreset recipes (planning/particles-dual-system.md §D.1). The
//  authoring overlay (effectinfo_xg.txt: `xg_preset <id>`) and the router reference these by string id; the
//  body of each recipe is a curated combination of the §B.3 modern draw features. The overlay may then
//  override individual knobs on top of the recipe (handled by the parser, not here).
//
//  Pure value lookups — no Godot deps — so this is unit-testable and shared by the router and the backend.
