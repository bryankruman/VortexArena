/// OFF-THREAD phase (VFS read + format parse + image decode — none of it touches Godot's RenderingServer) runs
/// on a small dedicated worker lane (see the lane note below), and the MAIN-THREAD phase (turning the parsed
/// data into a <c>Mesh</c>/<c>Material</c>/<c>Texture</c> + attaching the node) is drained from a priority queue
/// in <see cref="_Process"/> under a small millisecond budget — so even a burst of requests never spikes a frame.
///
/// <para>Requests carry a <see cref="Priority"/> (a viewmodel swap the player is waiting on = High, a distant
/// player's model = Low); the main-thread drain always builds the highest-priority ready job first. The off-
/// thread phase produces a value of type <c>T</c>; <c>onMain</c> consumes it on the main thread. A null off-
/// thread result (a missing/failed asset) is dropped silently.</para>

/// <para>This is the general mechanism; the felt cold-load cases are already covered eagerly (A3 precaches all
/// weapons/combat-sounds/default models, S3 idle-warms the rest), so today it is wired for the idle player-model
