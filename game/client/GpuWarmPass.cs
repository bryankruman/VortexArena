/// match hitches while the GPU stalls compiling. This parents one hidden instance of every runtime-created
/// material family into a tiny isolated 64×64 <see cref="SubViewport"/> (its OWN <c>World3D</c>, so nothing
/// touches the main scene — no visible flash) and lets it render for a few frames, forcing those compiles up
/// front. The first real effect in play then hits a warm pipeline.
///
/// The warm instances reference the SAME cached materials/meshes real spawns use (the A1 resource caches in
/// <see cref="EffectSystem"/> / <see cref="ProjectileRenderer"/>), so a single render frame compiles the exact
/// pipelines play will need. Self-managing: it counts a few rendered frames (one to let the one-shot particles
/// emit + draw, a couple to flush) then frees itself — and with it the SubViewport and every warm instance. The
/// cached Resources survive (the live renderers hold their own references); only this pass's extra refs drop.
