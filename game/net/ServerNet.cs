    //  (§13.5) S5 thread split — the ROOT-CAUSE fix for the threaded prediction desync.
    //
    //  The first S5 design ran the WHOLE Tick (transport + sim) on the worker. But the Godot ENet transport
    //  (ENetMultiplayerPeer / PacketPeerUDP, created on the MAIN thread in ServerNet.Start) is main-thread-
    //  affine — servicing it from the worker mis-delivered/garbled snapshots, so the client reconciled against
    //  corrupt authoritative state and prediction ran away (camera through walls, projectiles from the server's
    //  stale position). The per-trace ConcurrencyGate fixed the sim-side crash storm but could never fix a
    //  CORRUPT-SNAPSHOT problem — the transport was the real culprit.
    //
    //  Fix: the worker runs ONLY the pure-C# sim (GameWorld.Frame — the heavy 4-12 ms cost S5 exists to move
    //  off the render thread); ALL Godot transport (receive/send/flush) stays on the MAIN thread. Every
    //  shared-world access on both sides is still serialised by _simGate, so it's race-free; we only changed
    //  WHICH thread touches the Godot objects. This is strictly more faithful to S5's stated intent.
