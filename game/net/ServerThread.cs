/// S5 (sv_threaded, default OFF) — the dedicated server-simulation worker thread for the listen/host path.
///
/// When the listen server is started with <c>sv_threaded 1</c> on a windowed (non-headless) host, the heavy
/// authoritative work — <see cref="ServerNet.Tick"/> → <see cref="GameWorld.Frame"/> → the 72 Hz
/// <c>SimulationLoop</c> ticks — moves off the Godot main thread onto THIS long-lived background thread, so the
/// render frame no longer blocks on the sim. The main thread keeps only client prediction + render.
///
/// ISOLATION MODEL (the lock-fallback chosen for S5; see _scratch/perf-specs/s5.md and the parityContract):
/// the host keeps ONE shared <see cref="GameWorld"/> and serialises ALL access with a single object — the
/// gate the host installs on <see cref="ServerNet.SimGate"/>. This worker's <see cref="ServerNet.Tick"/> takes
/// that gate around the whole tick; the main thread takes the SAME gate around the span of <c>NetGame._Process</c>
/// that reads server-world state and runs the prediction replay. The two therefore never touch the entity table
/// concurrently. (The cleaner two-world split — a client-private prediction facade — was the spec's primary
/// design, but the listen host's <c>_Process</c> interleaves direct <c>_serverWorld</c>/<c>LocalServerPlayer</c>/
/// mutator reads with the prediction loop so densely that splitting them risked the default-off parity contract;
/// the spec authorises this lock fallback as the documented escape hatch — "correct-and-default-off-inert beats
/// clever-but-fragile".)
///
/// NOTHING here runs when sv_threaded is 0: the host never constructs a ServerThread, never installs a SimGate,
/// and the main thread calls <see cref="ServerNet.Tick"/> directly exactly as today.
///
/// THREAD SAFETY: this is pure C# work (<c>ServerNet</c>/<c>GameWorld</c>/<c>SimulationLoop</c>) — no Godot
/// scene-tree / RenderingServer call happens on it. The only Godot touches reached from <see cref="ServerNet.Tick"/>
/// are <c>GD.Print</c>/<c>GD.PrintErr</c> diagnostics, which route through Godot 4's thread-safe message queue.
