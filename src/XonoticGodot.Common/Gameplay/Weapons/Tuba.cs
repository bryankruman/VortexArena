/// The @!#%'n Tuba — port of common/weapons/weapon/tuba.{qh,qc}. A hidden splash weapon that "plays notes"
/// which damage and knock back nearby enemies. Each press (primary or secondary) plays a note, which
/// applies a small radius blast centered on the player. The note's pitch is chosen from the movement keys
/// held; secondary plays a higher pitch. Reload cycles through three instruments (Tuba/Accordion/Klein
/// Bottle). It uses no ammo.
///
/// Identity/attributes from tuba.qh; balance from bal-wep-xonotic.cfg (g_balance_tuba_*).
/// This port covers the per-note radius blast (a HITTYPE_SOUND attack that never hurts teammates), the
/// sustained note entity (held -> refresh, release -> note-off), the W_Tuba_GetNote pitch selection
/// (derived from movement direction since key input is headless), the instrument cycling on reload
/// (Tuba/Accordion/Klein Bottle, which carries the HITTYPE_SECONDARY/BOUNCE obituary bits), the per-note
/// smoke ring, and the wr_setup instrument reset on equip. The note SOUND is now a sustained, pitch-stepped
/// loop on CH_TUBA (Play(loop:true)+Stop with a 2^(m/12) pitch shift on the residual; cl_tuba_volume/
/// attenuation honored). Only the ENT_CLIENT_TUBANOTE remote-player networking, the cl_tuba_fadetime release
/// fade, and the two-sample cos/sin crossfade, plus the melody-recognition chat bprint line, remain
