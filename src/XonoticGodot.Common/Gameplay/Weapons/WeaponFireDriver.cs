/// <c>weapon_prepareattack</c> + <c>weapon_thinkf</c> (server/weapons/weaponsystem.qc). It owns the
/// raise/ready/fire/drop state machine for a player's weapon slot(s), reads the player's
/// <c>BUTTON_ATCK</c>/<c>BUTTON_ATCK2</c> from the per-tick input, gates fire rate via the per-slot
/// <c>ATTACK_FINISHED</c> refire timer, and routes BOTH fire modes into the active weapon's
/// <see cref="Weapon.WrThink"/>.
///
/// <para><b>Why this exists:</b> previously <c>GameWorld.WeaponThink</c> called
/// <c>WrThink(p, slot 0, Primary)</c> unconditionally every server tick, so every weapon fired once per
/// tick, refire/animtime cvars were ignored, the secondary never fired, and slots &gt; 0 never drove. This
/// driver fixes all of that.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Faithful structure:</b> mirroring QC, the active weapon's <see cref="Weapon.WrThink"/> is called
/// EVERY tick with the held fire mode(s) so per-tick upkeep still runs (Vortex charge regen, Hook reel-in,
/// Devastator guiding, Crylink link-join, Arc beam continuation). The refire <i>gate</i> lives inside the
/// weapon, in <see cref="Weapon.PrepareAttack"/> (== QC's <c>weapon_prepareattack</c>), which each weapon
/// calls before it actually fires: it rejects the shot while <c>time &lt; ATTACK_FINISHED</c>, checks ammo,
/// and on success advances the timer + schedules the return-to-READY animation.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Slots:</b> QC supports up to <c>MAX_WEAPONSLOTS</c> independent weapon entities (dual-wielding).
/// This port currently tracks a single active weapon (<see cref="Entity.ActiveWeaponId"/>); slot 0 carries
/// it. The loop is written over all slots for fidelity / future dual-wield, but only slot 0 is populated
/// today.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Deferred to the next wave (T6):</b> the precise raise/drop switch <i>delays</i>
/// (<c>switchdelay_raise/drop</c>) and the clip-reload system (<c>clip_load</c>/<c>clip_size</c>/
/// <c>W_Reload</c>). Clean hooks for both exist (the WS_RAISE/WS_DROP transitions in
