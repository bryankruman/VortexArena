// Port of qcsrc/server/round_handler.qc — the shared round-elimination state machine used by the
// round-based gametypes (Clan Arena, Freeze Tag, and the round-based variants of others). In QuakeC this
// was a single `round_handler` edict whose think function (round_handler_Think) cycled through:
//   wait-for-players  → countdown  → round-in-progress  → end-delay  → (next round)
// driven by three callbacks the gametype installs (round_handler_Spawn): canRoundStart, canRoundEnd,
// roundStart. We reproduce that driver headlessly as a plain object the gametype owns and ticks; it is
// Godot-free and depends only on the engine clock via the gametype's own time source.

/// <summary>
/// The round-elimination driver — the Godot-free port of QuakeC's <c>round_handler</c> (server/round_handler.qc).
/// A gametype creates one and ticks it every frame; it sequences the wait/countdown/round/end-delay phases and
/// invokes the supplied callbacks:
///  - <see cref="CanRoundStart"/> (QC canRoundStart): may the countdown proceed? (every team has players);
///  - <see cref="CanRoundEnd"/> (QC canRoundEnd): is the round decided? (a team won / stalemate) — returns true
///    when the round is over;
///  - <see cref="OnRoundStart"/> (QC roundStart): called once when the countdown hits zero and the round begins.
/// The countdown length, end-delay, and per-round time limit mirror the QC <c>round_handler_Init</c> args.
///
/// Parity (2026-06-22, W1-round-handler seam): the think loop now reproduces the QC <c>round_handler_Think</c>
/// cadence faithfully — the <see cref="GameStartTime"/> pre-game hold (<c>time &lt; game_starttime</c>), the
/// <see cref="IntermissionRunning"/> idle, the <b>1 Hz</b> countdown granularity (QC <c>nextthink = time + 1</c>,
/// so the countdown ticks once a second, not once per frame), the per-second <see cref="OnCountdownTick"/>
/// announcer edge, and the once-per-round <see cref="OnRoundCounted"/> (QC the <c>ROUNDS_PL</c> score bump) and
/// <see cref="OnRoundReset"/> (QC <c>reset_map(false)</c> on the next round). <see cref="RoundEndTime"/> /
/// <see cref="RoundsPlayed"/> are also publicly settable so a host that drives a separate live handler can mirror
/// the round timing into the gametype's own handler (which the gametype's <c>CheckWinner</c> reads).
