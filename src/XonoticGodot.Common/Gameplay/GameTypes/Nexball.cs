/// The Nexball gametype — port of <c>CLASS(NexBall, Gametype)</c>
/// (common/gametypes/gametype/nexball/nexball.qh + sv_nexball.qc).
///
/// A team sport: players carry/shoot a ball and try to put it through the enemy team's goal. Putting the ball
/// in the <em>enemy</em> goal scores a point for the scorer's team (QC <c>GoalTouch</c> → pscore=+1,
/// TeamScore_AddToTeam(ST_NEXBALL_GOALS)); an own-goal or a "fault" goal costs a point (pscore=−1, credited
/// to the other team in a two-team game). The first team to the goal limit (cvar <c>g_nexball_goallimit</c>,
/// default 5) wins (QC GameRules_limit_score). It is a weapon-arena gametype (only the ball-launcher weapon).
///
/// Faithfully ported (the goal-scoring rule):
///  - per-team goal tally (<see cref="GoalsFor"/>, routed through the unified GameScores team store);
///  - goal resolution via <see cref="ScoreGoal"/> (own-goal/fault → −1 to other team; enemy goal → +1);
///  - goal-limit win check (<see cref="GoalLimit"/>, QC g_nexball_goallimit) and winning team.
///
/// Faithfully ported (objective layer):
///  - the ball entity (basketball/football) with carry/drop/reset (<see cref="SpawnBall"/>/
///    <see cref="GiveBall"/>/<see cref="DropBall"/>, QC GiveBall / DropBall / ResetBall);
///  - the goal trigger entities (team goals + GOAL_FAULT + GOAL_OUT) and the GoalTouch dispatch that derives
///    the goal kind and scores it (<see cref="SpawnGoal"/>/<see cref="GoalTouch"/>, QC GoalTouch pscore).
///
/// Deferred (NOTE — cross-boundary): the ball physics tuning (bounce factors, basketball meter), the ball-launcher arena
/// weapon, the ball/goal models + waypoint sprites (CSQC), and score networking — client or weapon concerns.
