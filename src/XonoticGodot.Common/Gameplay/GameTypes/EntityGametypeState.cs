// Port of the per-entity gametype-object state and the shared gametype-entity infrastructure.
//
// In QuakeC the gametype objectives (CTF flags, KeyHunt keys, Keepaway/Nexball balls, Domination control
// points, Race/CTS checkpoints, Onslaught generators/control-points, Assault objectives) were ordinary
// edicts carrying a pile of flat ".fields" (.ctf_status / .owner / .flagcarried, .owner key carrier,
// .goalentity owner, .race_checkpoint, .health generator, ...). Entity is `partial`, so — exactly like
// Items/EntityResources.cs and MapObjects/MapObjectsCommon.cs — we promote those fields here in a NEW file
// without editing Entity.cs, and add the shared spawn/sound/scoring shims the gametype code reuses.
//
// The deterministic simulation (XonoticGodot.Engine) runs the entities' Think/Touch the same way the QC engine
// did; this file is Godot-free and depends only on the engine-services facade (Api.*).
