///
/// Players race a fixed sequence of <c>trigger_race_checkpoint</c> entities; crossing the final checkpoint
/// completes a lap. The match runs in one of two modes (QC <c>g_race_qualifying</c>):
///  - qualifying: every racer runs solo against the clock; ranking is by fastest single lap
///    (QC SP_RACE_FASTEST, SFL_LOWER_IS_BETTER);
///  - race: head-to-head; first to the lap limit (cvar <c>g_race_laps_limit</c>) wins, ties broken by time.
/// The match ends when a racer reaches the lap limit, OR (QC <c>WinningCondition_Race</c>) once every racer
/// has finished — at which point a sudden-death overtime is started unless all laps were raced.
///
/// Faithfully ported (the timing/scoring rule):
///  - per-player lap + checkpoint + fastest-lap state (<see cref="RaceState"/>);
///  - lap-limit win check (<see cref="LapLimit"/>, QC g_race_laps_limit / GameRules_limit_score);
///  - "everyone finished ⇒ match over" condition (QC WinningCondition_Race n == c).
///
/// Faithfully ported (objective layer):
///  - the checkpoint trigger entities + ordered crossing detection (<see cref="SpawnCheckpoint"/> /
///    <see cref="CheckpointTouch"/>, QC trigger_race_checkpoint + checkpoint_passed / race_NextCheckpoint):
///    a racer must cross checkpoints in sequence; the finish line (index 0) closes a lap;
///  - per-player lap/checkpoint timing + fastest-lap tracking (<see cref="RaceState"/>, QC race_* fields);
///  - record persistence (QC race_readTime/race_writeTime via <see cref="RaceRecords"/>): closing a lap files
///    the lap time into the per-map top-99 ranking, classified for the host's INFO_RACE_* notification;
///  - qualifying mode (QC g_race_qualifying): solo time-trial — closing a lap re-teleports the racer to start
///    (the finish kill-delay <see cref="OnFinishRetract"/>), ranking by fastest lap; in plain race mode the
///    racer keeps going until the lap limit, then is retracted.
///
/// Faithfully ported (depth):
///  - penalty zones (<see cref="SpawnPenaltyZone"/>/<see cref="PenaltyTouch"/>/<see cref="SetPenalty"/>, QC
///    trigger_race_penalty + race_ImposePenaltyTime): a racer entering one is frozen for the penalty time in a
///    plain race, or has it added to the lap time in qualifying, expired by <see cref="Tick"/>;
///  - sudden-death overtime (<see cref="SuddenDeath"/>, QC WinningCondition_Race): the lap limit alone never
///    ends the race — it runs on until everyone finishes;
///  - the qualifying==2 → race transition (<see cref="TransitionQualifyingToRace"/>, QC rc_SetLimits +
///    reset_map_global): clears qualifying, restores the saved fraglimit/leadlimit/timelimit, re-runs the
///    score rules, and resets every racer;
///  - team race (<see cref="RaceTeams"/>, QC g_race_teams): laps add up into ST_RACE_LAPS.
