/// Keepaway — port of <c>CLASS(Keepaway, Gametype)</c>
/// (common/gametypes/gametype/keepaway/{keepaway.qh,sv_keepaway.qc}). A single ball sits on the map;
/// hold it to score. The carrier earns points over time (g_keepaway_score_timepoints) and a bonus per
/// kill made while carrying (g_keepaway_score_killac); killing the carrier earns the killer a bonus
/// (g_keepaway_score_bckill). First player to the point limit (g_keepaway_point_limit, default 30) wins.
///
/// NOTE on TeamGame: in Xonotic, Keepaway is a FREE-FOR-ALL objective mode — its gametype flags are
/// <c>GAMETYPE_FLAG_USEPOINTS</c> only, with NO <c>GAMETYPE_FLAG_TEAMPLAY</c> (see keepaway.qh
/// gametype_init "timelimit=20 pointlimit=30", no teams= arg). We therefore set <see cref="TeamGame"/> =
/// false to stay faithful to the QC source. (The team variant is a SEPARATE gametype, "tka" /
/// TeamKeepaway, common/gametypes/gametype/tka — out of scope here.) The brief grouped Keepaway with the
/// team modes; the faithful port keeps it FFA, with per-player scoring rather than per-team.
///
/// QC defaults: "timelimit=20 pointlimit=30".
///
/// Faithfully ported (Godot-free essence):
///  - a single ball with a carrier (<see cref="BallState"/>, QC .ballcarried / keepawayball entity);
///  - pickup / drop (<see cref="PickUp"/>/<see cref="Drop"/>, QC ka_TouchEvent / ka_DropEvent);
///  - per-frame time scoring for the carrier (<see cref="Tick"/>, QC ka_BallThink_Carried →
///    g_keepaway_score_timepoints * frametime) and the kill bonuses on the obituary bus
///    (carrier-kill bonus to the killer, kill-while-carrying bonus to the carrier);
///  - point-limit win condition (pointlimit).
///
/// Faithfully ported (objective layer):
///  - a single world ball entity spawned at map start (<see cref="SpawnBall"/>, QC ka_SpawnBalls) with
///    touch = pickup and a respawn timer when loose (<see cref="RespawnBall"/>, QC ka_RespawnBall);
///  - pickup attaches the ball to the carrier, drop detaches and re-arms the respawn (<see cref="PickUp"/>/
///    <see cref="Drop"/>, QC ka_TouchEvent / ka_DropEvent);
///  - the ballcarrier damage/force scaling matrix (<see cref="DamageScale"/>, QC Damage_Calculate
///    ballcarrier/noncarrier damage/force).
///
/// Wired in Wave 2: the procedural ball now spawns through the shared <see cref="BallEntity"/> framework
/// (<see cref="SpawnBall"/>/<see cref="AdoptBall"/>, driven by the host round-drive seam), pickup/drop/world-touch
/// play their KA sounds + notifications (<see cref="PickUp"/>/<see cref="Drop"/>/<see cref="BallTouchEntity"/>),
/// the carried ball orbits its carrier each <see cref="Tick"/>, the 0.5 s self-recapture lockout is honored, the
/// possession damage/force matrix reads the real vector cvars (<see cref="DamageScale"/>), and normal frags are
/// suppressed (<see cref="OnGiveFragsForKill"/>). The HUD KA_CARRYING mod-icon reads <see cref="Ball"/>.Carrier
/// via the net status block, so simply maintaining the carrier feeds it.
///
/// Deferred (NOTE — cross-boundary): the ball model/glow/effects + respawn/spark particles + waypoint sprites
/// (CSQC presentation), the carried-ball invisibility alpha sync, multiple-ball chaining
/// (g_keepaway_ballcarrier_maxballs), the carrier highspeed PlayerPhysics modifier (g_keepaway_ballcarrier_highspeed),
/// and the use-key / disconnect / observe drop triggers (need the PlayerUseKey / MakePlayerObserver / ClientDisconnect
/// / DropSpecialItems mutator hooks, which are not yet on MutatorHooks — see todos). Death-drop IS wired (OnDeath).
