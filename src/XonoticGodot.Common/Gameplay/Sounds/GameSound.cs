// Port of QuakeC's sound registry (common/sounds/sound.qh, all.inc, all.qh).
//
// In QC a sound is a registered Object: `CLASS(Sound)` with a `sound_str` path, enrolled via the
// `SOUND(name, path)` macro into the `Sounds` registry (REGISTRY(Sounds, BITS(9))). At precache time
// `_Sound_fixpath` resolves the bare path to an actual file (.wav on the server, the first existing of
// .wav/.ogg/.flac on the client). The constant `SND_<name>` then refers to that registered descriptor.
//
// Here a GameSound is the C# successor: one immutable descriptor per sound, enrolled into the self-
// registering `Sounds` catalog (NOT the attribute/reflection bootstrap — see SoundsList.RegisterAll).
// The descriptor carries the bare sample path, a default channel, and default volume/attenuation so a
// caller can `Api.Sound.Play(...)` (or use SoundSystem) without re-deriving those each time.

/// on that channel) from the negative "autochannel" variants (a fresh transient emitter per play, so
/// overlapping plays stack). That distinction is preserved via <see cref="GameSound.Single"/>; the channel
