/// <summary>
/// The Breakable Hook mutator — port of common/mutators/mutator/breakablehook/sv_breakablehook.qc. Makes the
/// grappling-hook chain shootable: shooting an enemy's hook chain destroys it (and deals a little splash
/// damage to its owner), while your own hook (and a teammate's) is left alone unless
/// <c>g_breakablehook_owner</c> lets you break your own. Enabled by the <c>g_breakablehook</c> cvar.
///
/// Ported (the Damage_Calculate handler): when the damaged entity is the grapple chain
/// (<c>classname == "grapplinghook"</c>), zero the damage if <c>!g_breakablehook</c> or (your own hook AND
/// !g_breakablehook_owner); and if the attacker is on a DIFFERENT team from the hook's owner, hurt the owner
/// for 5 (WEP_HOOK | HITTYPE_SPLASH) and remove the hook. The port's grapple IS a shootable
/// <c>"grapplinghook"</c> entity (Hook.cs: classname "grapplinghook", takedamage Aim, a ProjectileDamage
/// callback), so this handler is live; the hook is removed by triggering its own ProjectileDamage callback
/// (the C# successor to QC's RemoveHook, which Hook.cs keeps private).
