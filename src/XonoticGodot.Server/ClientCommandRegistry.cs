// Port of server/command/reg.qh (CLIENT_COMMANDS vs SERVER_COMMANDS registries) and the
// server/command/cmd.qc SV_ParseClientCommand dispatch split + floodcheck-exempt switch.
//
// QC has TWO command registries: SERVER_COMMANDS (sv_cmd.qc / banning.qc — server-console/rcon only) and
// CLIENT_COMMANDS (cmd.qc — client-callable via `cmd <name>`). SV_ParseClientCommand, the engine entry for a
// client's `clc_stringcmd`, dispatches a client command ONLY through CheatCommand, CommonCommand_macro_command
// (server/command/common.qc — also client-callable) and ClientCommand_macro_command (CLIENT_COMMANDS). It does
// NOT route the generic family (set/seta/cvar/toggle/rpn/maplist/settemp/… in common/command/generic.qc) nor the
// SERVER_COMMANDS (restart/endmatch/kick/map/gotomap/ban/…), so those are server-only and must be rejected when
// a client issues them.
//
// Our port collapses both QC registries into ONE Commands table keyed by name; this registry is the membership
// test that restores the QC privilege separation: a name here is a CLIENT_COMMAND / common-command / cheat and
// may be invoked with a non-null caller; anything else is SERVER-ONLY (caller must be null). See the T47 gate in
// Commands.Execute and the 3-gate pre-filter in ServerNet.HandleClientCommand.
