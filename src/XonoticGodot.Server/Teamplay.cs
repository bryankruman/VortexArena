/// computes each team's weighted mean skill and <see cref="CompareTeams"/> breaks equal-size ties by strength
/// only when the skill gap is statistically significant (z &gt; <c>..._significance_threshold</c> SDs), so a
/// strong player counts as "more" than a weak one but skill never reorders teams of unequal size), the bot
/// autobalance (<see cref="AutoBalanceBots"/>, QC <c>TeamBalance_AutoBalanceBots</c>: move the lowest-scoring
/// bot from the largest to the smallest team when uneven), and <see cref="KillPlayerForTeamChange"/>
/// (QC the forced death + score clear on a mid-match team move). A <see cref="SkillProvider"/> supplies each
/// player's skill (bots feed their <c>skill</c> level) since TrueSkill mu/variance ratings aren't modeled.
