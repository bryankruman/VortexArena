# Port of Base/xonotic-linux-dedicated.sh (a symlink to xonotic-linux-sdl.sh, which derives the
# dedicated mode from $0 and ALWAYS cd's to its own directory first — the working-directory
# contract: game data is found relative to the install dir, Base/Makefile help says so explicitly).
#
# XonoticGodot equivalent: the exported build resolves `assets/data` against the CWD
# (GameDemo.ResolveDataPath — GlobalizePath("res://") is "" in an exported build), so this script
# cd's to its own directory and execs the dedicated binary from there. Ship it INSIDE the
# dist/linux-dedicated/ folder, next to the binary + assets/data/ (tools/package.sh does this).
#
# Usage:   ./run-dedicated.sh [map] [extra engine args...]
#          GAMETYPE=ctf ./run-dedicated.sh stormkeep --bots 4
#
# v1 caveat (ADR-0014): `--headless --host` is a headless LISTEN server (the same host loop with a
# dummy renderer + a local dummy client) — the true client-less dedicated mode (DP host.c
# ca_dedicated) is a deferred Shell/NetGame seam.
