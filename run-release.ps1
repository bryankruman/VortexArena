# run-release.ps1 — export + launch a TRUE RELEASE build of XonoticGodot.
#   Optimized C# (csharp=Release) AND godot-context=release, with NO editor/debugger overhead.
#   Running from the Godot editor or a Rider "Player"/Run config ALWAYS loads the Debug assembly and reports
#   godot-context=debug, regardless of the Rider build configuration — an export is the only real release test.
#
# Run it directly in the Rider terminal (it's PowerShell):   .\run-release.ps1
#   with game args:                                          .\run-release.ps1 --host atelier --gametype dm
